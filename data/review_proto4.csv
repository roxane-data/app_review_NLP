Great value for money. Food was still fresh and delicious,5,Google,2021-12-29
occasionally a surprise bag is offered after the establishment is already closed.,4,Google,2021-12-29
"Well-designed app except they really need to add a pickup time filter. Merchant experience: Great for getting baked goods from coffee shops (muffins, bagels, croissants, etc.) but you have to wait until late afternoon or later. You spent $5 gets to get a bag of 4 items. So far the full meals (2 out of 2) haven't been great though.",5,Google,2021-12-29
"Thanks for the reply! It makes sense to not notify all users about a new bag, that's true. Unfortunately I didn't get any response on my email whatsoever about the failing payment. It still does not work.",1,Google,2021-12-29
A good buy will definitely use again,5,Google,2021-12-29
only app I get check constantly.,4,Google,2021-12-29
"Only used it once. Some of the food I collected was mouldy and unfit for consumption. I received a full refund, but have not used the app since.",3,Google,2021-12-29
great app.only ever had great surprises on this app.some of the best bakeries/restaurants are available! neat:),5,Google,2021-12-29
"Great mission! Just have reasonable expectations. Some vendors will give foods that are not worth the deal they claimed, but some give a great deal. If you can tolerate / experiment with varying results, it's a great app with an awesome mission to reduce food waste.",5,Google,2021-12-29
"Great value, surprise fun, easy, fast inexpensive.",5,Google,2021-12-28
Fab app!!,5,Google,2021-12-28
App looks great. Helpdesk could be a lot better and the app is easy to use.,2,Google,2021-12-28
"Done last minute and very surprise at the amount we was given, friendly staff good portion sizes, can't fault, try it, won't be disappointed, hey the guy before us took x12, yes 12 so can't be that bad. :)",5,Google,2021-12-28
Amazing! Wish I had known years ago. An abundance of food!,5,Google,2021-12-28
amazing,5,Google,2021-12-28
it's an amazing app I wish I would have discovered earlier.,5,Google,2021-12-28
Got food today dated 14th Dec fruit was going off had to throw things away very disappointed only yoghurt got yesterday's date on won't use this app again üòï,1,Google,2021-12-28
"So easy to use, pretty, clear, and an amazing concept. I'm saving a fortune and also getting to feel eco-smug üòÅ",5,Google,2021-12-28
"Very disappointing and unreliable app. This is the 3rd time im experiencing that the restaurant has no food to give, although i have already paid and asked for my food bag within the pick up time. Plus, the customer cannot cancel the order within the pickup time while the restaurant can. This means that you go to collect your food by your own means amid the risk of receiving nothing. Super unfair. I am no longer using toogoodtogo. Sorry but your business needs a lot of improvement.",1,Google,2021-12-28
"This is a great app for value food. Admittedly where I live there aren't so many shops that are close, but there are enough that I can use this app every now and again for some treats. Pretty much all the bags I've had from shops have been good, and some have been fantastic. If you have a problem their support team is also really good. Solid app, recommended. üëçüèªüëçüèª",5,Google,2021-12-28
The idea is great and I support it. App working with out any issues.,5,Google,2021-12-28
"Update to a previous glowing review, had a couple terrible experiences similar to other reviewers who said they bought from places trying to use this as a way to sell stale food at near retail pricing. Great concept if you live in a big city with plenty of shops that buy into this to choose from, but if you're in the suburbs don't expect much. Definitely agree with the 5 star concept, 3 star execution I read in another review.",3,Google,2021-12-28
Excellent value for money. Super easy to order with a delicious meal still piping hot to eat in the comfort of your home.,5,Google,2021-12-28
A great effort for helping reduce waste for the business and consumer. Please tell EVERYONE about this app,5,Google,2021-12-28
Not available in Canada? has no stores located in Ontario! At least where I live in Sudbury,1,Google,2021-12-28

Love it!,5,Google,2021-12-27
"Just had our second box, amazing value. All great stuff",5,Google,2021-12-27
Great,5,Google,2021-12-27
"Great idea, great prices for what you get, and easy to use app. Just need to implement useful notifications: I want to know when one of my favorites lists something instead of having to go to the app to check just in case. Especially important for shops that don't regularly sell on here (but you want to know when they do). Five stars if that's implemented. I also want to see my favorites on the map, please add favourites as a filter.",4,Google,2021-12-27
"Hit or miss, not many places available yet but overall a good experience so far.",4,Google,2021-12-27
Absolutely fantastic idea! I loved my magic box excellent Value x,5,Google,2021-12-27
"Good concept. Poor execution. Lack of user feedback, the reviews for restaurants and other clients are kept hidden from the user. Restaurants are not aware of the app upon arrival. I'd request more transparency for the users and make the reviews public.",2,Google,2021-12-27
Fab site for saving food and money.,5,Google,2021-12-27
good experience and glad I could save money and help with food wastage,5,Google,2021-12-26
So far so good. Two meals for the quid!,5,Google,2021-12-26
The idea is great but the lack of indications about diatery options on a package makes it unfriendly for vegans or diabetes.,3,Google,2021-12-26
Treats employees like absolute dogshit. Abusive practices and green washing.,1,Google,2021-12-25
"Great app, saving money saving food waste can't go wrong",5,Google,2021-12-25
"This services uses magic links which is a VERY insecure way of account verification. In simple terms, your account can very easily be comprised leading to data loss. Avoid providing any real data on this app, and never provide them any payment information.",1,Google,2021-12-25
"Good value, great service, lovely staff",5,Google,2021-12-25
the person or people who ever got this app off the ground and managed to get all these stars involved stop all this wastage of food good on you good job,5,Google,2021-12-25
didn't think I would ever use this app but I see the appeal now and it is for a great cause.,5,Google,2021-12-24
Nice,5,Google,2021-12-24
"It's a great idea. But all too often it doesn't send notifications. I think this is sometimes because the shops have control over this function. I've arrived at 17:00 collection only to be told I'm too early. Then watched the time change on the app, 5 minutes later to another later time. Today's went earlier, again no notice, same shop. So no bag and no refund. Last time I use this app. Complaints are handled by an unfeeling, inflexible Bot. So no chance of getting any justice either.",2,Google,2021-12-24
brilliant value for money,5,Google,2021-12-24
I have been using toogoodtogo for a long time now because it allows you to buy good quality food for less! It also allows me to try out food I have never tried before,5,Google,2021-12-24
"I've made a reservation to collect via the app and was given the 30 minutes windows from 5pm. The shop closed at 4pm, and I was given no notice of refund or cancellation.",1,Google,2021-12-24

great service and great offers,5,Google,2021-12-24
it give you the option to get delirium food that would otherwise go to waist,5,Google,2021-12-24
"I used this app the first time this evening, was recommended by a friend & thought I'd give it a go. Simply put a number of shops have food at the end of the day they sell for cheap, rather than throw away. I picked a local Caribbean takeaway, paid noted I had to bring containers (not always required). When you request a ""bag"" you don't know exactly what you going to get.. however its always more than you a actually paid. so either way its a very good win.",5,Google,2021-12-24

"love this app, so easy to use, and makes me feel like I'm doing my bit extra",5,Google,2021-12-23
4.5 stars. Great app and idea. Eco heaven! My only beef? The app doesn't have a good method to alert last-minute buyers via a real-time countdown that their window to buy is ending.,4,Google,2021-12-23

Great value if u like alot of different foods. if ur fussy there not that good,5,Google,2021-12-22
for people who work away from home on a nightshift. it's a fantastic app. it's difficult to eat sensibly living out a hotel room. great value. plus beggars can't be choosers.,5,Google,2021-12-21

"Great app. What a great way to, not only help save the environment but people's pockets too! No need for negative comments about the contents of bags etc. Staff cannot be expected to upload all this info and offer at such a discounted price. It's luck of the draw what you get, that's one of the upshots for me. Been using a few weeks and my only niggle is that bags sell so quick! That can't be a bad thing.",5,Google,2021-12-20

"This app is one of the greatest ones I have ever used. An absolute MUST HAVE for artists, musicians, families, and/or the working poor. Connects people with food and the opportunity to try restaurants that would otherwise be out of budget. Saves time, solves food waste issues, and connects people, small businesses, and communities.

Seems more like a shopping app. I'm pretty sure back when it started there was free food that was going to be thrown away but now it's more like the advertise ¬£8 mystery bags of food. Not really sure this is in the spirit of 'too good to go' because at that point you're just shopping.,3,Google,2021-12-18

"Waste of time. Purchased magic bag, turned up to the store at the right time to be told there were no bags avaliable. (even though there were still advertising more bags on app!) Told I'd have to go on the app for a refund but there is no refund request on the app. Wasted more time emailing customer services. This app is marketing towards buying a surprise bag to save the world of food waste but its fraud if you purchase something that turns out to not even exist. Shouldn't be allowed to trade",1,Google,2021-12-18

"5‚≠ê concept, 3‚≠ê execution. Great for discovering new places but a tedious app to use. No way to sort by common sense filters like distance, time of day, or type of food. ""Nearby"" includes places 40+mins away on foot. Save list is jumbled, not even sorted by different cities. Users should be able to check off even general categories of the food they received so people can know what variety is possible. Went to a dinner spot but got cookies and bread. Still using app, but hoping for improvements.",3,Google,2021-12-17

All of the products were expired! A smoothie since September!!!! It was a surprise bag but the surprise is that the products were 90% not edible. What a joke!,2,Google,2021-12-17
Designed by fools. Why is the app locked after making a payment - waiting for confirmation? I get confirmation immediately but the app is locked for > five minutes.

I like the app. It's a good idea. A lot of places are a bit too far away for me though. There's ups and downs with food. I've had chicken that smelled bad. I've had a carrier bag full of lovely food. I've had only 3 small things too that was not worth the drive. Never had a problem with the app itself. I'm going vegan soon. So see how that works out.,4,Google,2021-12-17

"The idea is great, but the app is very buggy, it often crashes when I try to place an order and charges me twice. You cannot cancel your order within 2 hours of pick up time, in this case it is awful. And it is really hard to get reply of customer support, for this one reason, I might never use the app ever again.",2,Google,2021-12-16

"Nice app, but if you don't always give permission to see the location, it doesn't work. I don't like to always grant that permission. In the app it says you can also manually choose a location (I would like to use the last known one), but that doesn't seem to work.",3,Google,2021-11-27
"Most places provide you the end-of-day they either have too much of our they couldn't sell. It's not for the selective eaters, but for the folks who like a great deal and very affordable food. Example: a pizza place emptied the remainder of their single slice carousel (~15 pieces) into a single box for us for $4.99. It was mostly cheese pizza, but it was delicious.",5,Google,2021-11-27
this is a great idea. picked up my first magic bag and it was the best one (greggs) . I had a variety of food. and the staff were very friendly. the two I reserved before were refunded. Nisa and costa. I've reserved another Costa magic bag,4,Google,2021-11-27

Neat concept and relatively painless to use besides a few glitches To dev: could have a better search and filter functions(eg. Store ratings) To new users: General rule is to avoid stores with an avg score less than 4. And do bring containers when the merchant request them.,5,Google,2021-11-27

"It is not clear how you should rate. There should be specific aspects that can be rated. Additionally, specify what each star means (e.g. 5 stars = exceeded expectations or 5 stars = nothing to complain or 5 stars = nothing can be improved), and mention examples, so ratings have actual meaning.; The fee is imho a bit much; I wish you could specify the distance in smaller steps (e.g. 5,6,7,8,9 km). Ideally the distance is traffic distance, not an air measurement.",5,Google,2021-11-27

"Hardly any shops do this and when they do it sells out before you get a chance. You set up favourites and it doesn't bother to alert you. This is the second time I've tried the app with a good 18m in between and it's just the same, nothing available anywhere. Another point is, you don't know if you'll get a shed load of useless items because no one is allowed to leave an actual review of the shop, they only report a rating out of 5. What use is that?! We want actual written reviews!",1,Google,2021-11-26
Fantastic little place with friendly staff.,5,Google,2021-11-26
Good app but really could do with an alert when favourite stores list their offers !,4,Google,2021-11-26
"Wanted to try the app and see what it does. My first order was canceled because ""no food needed saving"" anymore. Second order, when I got to the restaurant the app was saying ""tap to collect"" but a lady working there said they don't have anything ready and she had to cancel all the orders. So I reported this through the app, a few minutes later I received an invoice for my order and money had been taken out of my account, yet I got no food whatsoever. Waste of time and money. Don't bother at all",1,Google,2021-11-26
"It's usually good for meals, timing is not very convenient but the price is good. Restaurant can cancelled the reservation last minute, and they can change the pickup time, they have a lot more power than customers. and the groceries deals are not really groceries from what I experienced, I got two bag of sauces for $6.",3,Google,2021-11-26

I've fed a family of 4 their evening meal twice for ¬£7 in total along with cookies to go with it, plus bread buns and scones with the following days date on. The only negative, but also positive since there was no waste, was that Starbucks had no waste but didn't tell me.

"I got this because I heard about it on NPR and got excited, lol. My main complaint is that unfortunately it seems to be limited to NYC and California (neither of which I'm in)..

"Not worth time nor money. Some shops sell multiple bags every day, and cancel them 10 minutes before pick up, when you're already on your way. Or you could arrive and the employees then claim that they cancelled the orders hours ago, or that someone already picked up the order. There are a few good ones, but some also jack up the prices to sell you overpriced stale bread impossible to cut with a knife. There are no way to comment on the stores, which would highlight such abuses to others.",1,Google,2021-11-19

"great ammount of food, although the ammount does vary. and very tasty variation.",5,Google,2021-11-19
Love the concept however restaurants should also be required to give two hours notice if they don't have any surplus food just like customers when cancelling or risk not receiving a refund. There have been multiple occasions where restaurants have cancelled my order less than half an hour before pick up time. I would most likely have left and be on my way and would miss this notification and therefore be wasting my time. The accountability should work both ways.,3,Google,2021-11-19

"Like the concept of the app. Today I have ordered for the first time and got disappointed!! How an app like this doesn't have any supervisory on the resturants? 5‚Ç¨ food that was not even eatable and the portion size was too small! I could have order a fresh full menu from BurgerKing with the same price and understand what I was eating! The point of choosing it is too have enough food with good quality and save food, NOT feed people with garbage! But I will try again to see if changed!",3,Google,2021-11-18
"It's a real mix. The app works well, for sure. A little glitchy at times, but better than many sustainability businesses that try to make an app. Here's the details. (1) no way to tell if a meal will be a good amount of food or two pastries. (2) the app employees are very eager about signing up restaurants: some restaurants have no idea that they are signed up for the service. (3) many businesses are abusing the service to just sell stuff near retail prices: e.g. $8 for a couple pastries.",3,Google,2021-11-18

"This app is easy to use but doesn't give good information about what you may end up getting. For instance, a restaurants photo shows a salad but you end up with pastries. Or the original value shows $12-$15 for $4.99 but you get so little that it's not even worth $2. So somewhat a little misleading. But most of my experiences have been good. They need to allow simple customer comments so other customers know what to expect at stores/restos. Also would be great to easily identify new locations.",4,Google,2021-11-17

Stupid. The site review rating but don't allow you to actual READ reviews. Wonder why. Sort by price? No Search by cuisine? No Hide unavailable deals? No,1,Google,2021-11-17
"Noble cause that fails in practice. You're overpaying for scraps whose real value gets inflated to make you think it's a great deal. Also, businesses treat you worse than a beggar (not realizing that they throw away a marketing opportunity, as many people use it to sample the goods/service). Any food that's worth saving is kept to be sold the next day or given to staff/family. Not worth the cost and hassle just for the illusion of doing something good.",2,Google,2021-11-17

"In general terms, it works very well, but the other day I went to pick up a package and the store had given everything away even before the time that I made the purchase. So there should be more synchronicity between the app and the stores registered. If this is fixed, I would give an A+.

"Edit:3 years later. Would love to get notifications. The map moves around too much, if I tap store card in the bottom horizontal list the map centers on it rapidly, makes me dizzy as that store can be far off. Save money and fight food waste at the same time. Love the app and the concept, excellent for larger cities. Lots of bakeries use this, great way to get cheap quality bread. Hopefully more of the grocery stores in Oslo will join soon, right now it's just a handful in the city centre.",5,Google,2021-11-14
"Ho cambiato la mia valutazione da 5 a 4 stelle perch√© capita sempre pi√π spesso che le magic box inserite non siano reali: si prenota e dopo 5 min l'ordine viene annullato.

"Good concept, but most don't give you much. Starbucks, Gregg's, Costa all give about 1 item per pound. Discounted, but not as cheap as making it yourself or a grocery discount rack. As a surprise bag, inevitably there are some items you don't actually want, decreasing value. Few notifications so you have to be constantly checking the app. The one good place in my area is snapped up immediately.

"Good concept but extremely poor execution. Have been using it only 3 weeks and not everyday - but already had two pick up issues. One time the store was simply closed, the other time the store shamelessly just said they are out of food (they are a cafe! Anything as compensation was acceptable but they just said no food).

This app is great the only reason ive put 4 n not 5 stars is because i think one thing i could really improve the app and thats notifications when your saved favourites stores have updated bags available. Its difficult trying to remember when each shop updates and catch them at all times of day n night. Such a great app though to use n saves a lot of money on food if your walking the breadline.,4,Google,2021-11-05

"This app is perfect, and it works well (in France). It's a great concept; it's everything it says it is, and the food is usually great and cheap.

This was the biggest waste of time. I paid $5 dollars for a Mexican food place thinking maybe a burrito or small tamale...they gave me a two small salsas. Will never use this again.

They need to work more with the restaurants/cafes/stores to put a proper description of what to expect (even if it's a surprise) so you go to a restaurant to get your magic bag and not get simple pastries and sweets. Plus food is getting worse every time and some places are putting prices as if it was fresh food. To good to go needs to work on that!,2,Google,2021-11-04
"This app is good if you don't have a young family as you have to collect the food so late in the evening, and I did expect that the main supermarkets asda,sainsbury,tesco,aldi,lidl would all be on board with helping to keep waisted food down.. The only decent food shop that's on board in my area is the European supermarket,were they sell beautiful fresh products can't wait to get my bag..",3,Google,2021-11-04

I thinks its a great initiative. more stores should sign up to reduce food waste. the only think I find annoying is you have to keep checking if something has become available which is not possible or the best use of one's time. some stores seem to be better than others in my experience. but thus dues give an option fir saving money on shopping from time to time especially if you cook regularly!,4,Google,2021-11-02

"I'm giving this app three out of five stars because it's a great deal about 60% of the time. 40% of the time it over-promises: the food is not in fact ready, or it's not a great portion of delicious food. This weekend, for example, we got great deals on produce and Asian snacks, but fondue chinoise was only one portion of one very greasy item, and I had to wait for it, and a Pakistani place on Fillmore made me wait even longer for a meal that was mostly starches.

"It's a shame you can't post public reviews, some places really aren't worth bothering with. Some employees don't bother to put more than a couple of items in. The quality of the magic bags is really going down hill. You sometimes get a fair amount/quality of food for the price. Unfortunately a lot of companies are just using it as a meal deal sort of thing with 4 leftover items for ¬£4 when there is clearly a lot on display going to waste.

"I think the idea, and the options are fantastic. I live in a Village so I don't have many options. However when I can grab a bag it's a huge help for me, as a cheap treat for my favorite coffee shops. I have told a family member about this app and she has used it traveling to Scotland and back. Saving money on hoilday. So it's worth a look for in your area and if you are out for a weekend at a concert. Can't really loss since you're fully refunded if the shop doesn't have enough food to give.",5,Google,2021-10-19

"The app has one major flaw. If you're vegan or vegetarian, it would be quite possible that you will get food that don't match your dietry requirements. No way to tell the business what not to put in your bag. Almost no vegan or vegetarian business to pick. I'm all for surprise food that won't go to waste, but some things I cannot eat will still go to waste.",2,Google,2021-10-19

"The concept is good but if anything goes wrong, then dont expect any support what so ever, had a support request in as i couldnt collect because i had just tested positive for covid.

"great idea and the app seems functional but steer clear if you have allergies or dietary restrictions. Everything is a surprise bag (I understand why they can't do specifics & that's fine), but I hope someday they can get the participating businesses to add labels like ""vegetarian "" or ""contains wheat, "" etc. etc. So it's more accessible to those of us that want to reduce waste, but unfortunately have limitations in our diets",3,Google,2021-10-18

I rarely write reviews on the app store but I decided to write one for this app so they can improve it. My main issue was that I'm a vegetarian and there are no filters for dietary restrictions in the app. The whole surprise box concept is so risky for me that I ended up just deleting the app. If I had an idea on the contents of the box I'd give it a try.,2,Google,2021-10-18

"I think its a great ideer but I think the organizer needs to remind the shops that this is not a trash bag................ending up with to bags of potatos and a few small things is not good enough. Also when complaining to the staff they told that the got told to put in woth 35 Kr insted of 90 Kr in Denmark . You need to remind the shops to let their staff no what should get inside the bag.

Fancy idea,5,Google,2021-10-10
No discount at all Checked the actual website of one of the offers (170g vegetarian butcher meat balls): the app says that the price was reduced from 12 to 4‚Ç¨ but the website clearly states that the product always costs 4‚Ç¨. What an abuse of this app!,1,Google,2021-10-10
amazing app. very helpful indeed,5,Google,2021-10-10
Not usable for anyone with any kind of allergies or dietary restrictions. It wouldn't be difficult to sort or label in general for vegetarian etc. Will probably uninstall since there's no opportunity for me to actually order. Also not a fan of the fact that you cannot read the reviews people leave. You only get to see a summary the app writes of the reviews they've received.,1,Google,2021-10-10

collection times for some orders are too late considering the dates on the items. restricting actual use at 9pm or later. some retailers do not give promised value of products as the items are already reduced and still not sold in store. not always a good deal considering its a lucky dip,3,Google,2021-10-09

"A good concept that doesn't work in practice as companies and/or the app look to it as a means to rip-off customers and increase their profits. Example: my girlfriend ordered what should have been $15 worth of product from Bagel Time on Danforth Ave. in Toronto, ON. What did we get? A dozen day old bagels. The retail price for a dozen day olds is $5.99. So, we got $5.99 worth of product and paid an extra $9.01 of pure profit to either the app or the restaurant. It's a rip-off/scam - avoid!",1,Google,2021-10-06

"The interaction with the very friendly staff was flawless. The bars are delicious and I particularly liked the plastic-free packaging. The only negative being that there is only reserved parking on site. I was visiting from Scotland.This could lead to a fine, if caught unawares. If you are able to visit on foot, do so.

Mala atenci√≥n a cliente. Algunos restaurantes no tienen verg√ºenza de usar la aplicaci√≥n para comida que tienen que tirar en la basura (pero porque est√° tan mal y antigua) una vez compr√© un pack de una de las tiendas que a la hora de sacar la comida huelia fatal la carne y ten√≠an otras cosas en el pack caducadas. Me fui y lo devolv√≠ y no lo denunci√© a la aplicaci√≥n (as√≠ cancel√© el pedido) el otro d√≠a vuelvo a comprar y un restaurante me da comida yo creo que ni se puede dejarla m√°s en la nevera.,1,Google,2021-10-01

App says food is worth $24 and I go to get it by paying $7.99. However the food I received is actually worth $7.99. Why does the app say the food is worth $24? I could have saved time and food at another restaurant close to my apartment instead of wasting time to travel and get food from the toogootogo restaurant for $7.99. Sometimes you really get what the app says. I paid $3.99 and got a meal worth $12,3,Google,2021-10-01

It seems no one takes care of google play store console - as no replies or comments from the company. The idea of the app itself is nice however the prosecution is not. App can't be loaded properly - It just give me loading indicator. And please hire someone to address users' complaints and comments here - you also need to communicate it to development team for fixing the bug/ product enhancement. This is one of the funnels you should listen - to understand your users.,2,Google,2021-09-29
"The experience is surprisingly lackluster. What should be a great opportunity for a business to make a connection with a new customer often ends up being food that should have already been in the garbage. Also, the app does not allow customers to see why a place might have only 2 stars. The app solely highlights the positives in text. So it feels kind of shady. Let the chips fall where they may!",2,Google,2021-09-29

"While the idea is good, the implementation is terrible. All you can buy are ""Surprise Bags""! You have no idea what food you are buying. If you have allergies or are vegetarian, good luck! But even if you're not, everyone has personal tastes. You may end of with macaroni salad and only like potato; with bananas but hate them; chicken breasts but prefer thighs, etc. Plus I've yet to find an offer closer than 7 Km, too far to bike, and a bus would add $3 to the $4-$6 price. (Heck, even if you drive, 7 Km each way is a long way to go for one surprise bag.) Loblaws has a similar idea, FlashFood, but there you know what you are buying.",2,Google,2021-09-24

As others have said it's a great app but please can we have a feature to select vegetarian/vegan options! I'm always worried that they won't be able to accommodate and food will go to waste.

"Good concept, middling execution. If I favorite a location, I'd expect to get a notification when they put a bag up. Also give a way to ""hide"" businesses. There's a business in my area that uses this as an online ordering system (pickup 10-5 every day, infinite bags available, more expensive than ordering in store for the same thing), I don't want to keep seeing them. I've also had a few orders cancelled <5min before pickup. I get it, but frustrating to just find parking and have it cancelled.",4,Google,2021-09-21

To avoid this I will either cycle to closest providers, or drive as part of another errand. However the later limits choice somewhat.

first time getting one of these goodie bags and really impressed with it! most of the things are marked down anyhow so if you did go in and buy them as they are they are just little bit over ¬£5 - but they might not be available on the shelf so... I think it's a nifty little thing cos you also get to try other things that you wouldn't have normally and that it only cost you a little money for it instead of the full price. it's a really cool idea and will continue to use it every so often!,5,Google,2021-09-16

"LOVE the concept but it's very YMMV. Half my orders get cancelled but that's better than showing up and there is no food to pick up. Very annoying if you've gone out of your way.

"My first time ordering a surprise bag through the app, and the experience greatly exceeded my expectations. The restaurant was easy to find, the staff was friendly, receiving the bag was quick and I was in and out in a couple of minutes, the food was delicious (falafel with tzatziki and another sauce and a soup, possibly vegan with garbanzo bean base and veggies, the perfect soup for a cold winter day), the amount of food was more than I expected, and for $3.99!!! Need I say more?",5,Google,2021-09-12
"Very hit and miss. The first few orders were good. A few bits were no good but mostly fine. The last few orders were pretty rubbish, 3 loafs of bread a day out of date is pointless as it's too late to even freeze. Its obvious there needs to be more variety to prevent the waste. It was more wasteful driving to collect it to then bin it at home. Costa always cancel the order just before collection and I'm still waiting on 4 refunds due to suppliers cancelling. I think that's us done now üëé",2,Google,2021-09-12

Doesn't work. Can't reserve anything,1,Google,2021-09-11
Interesting concept but doesn't work in practice. The food vendors just reserve food for people coming from this app. For them it is just another marketing tool to attract customers. Most of vendors will put out a deal late at night for the next day so they don't really know what will be left but they already sold you a deal. This is also why you see the same number of deals every time from a vendor. You do get food at a discount and you get to try places you wouldn't go otherwise.,3,Google,2021-09-11

This is a great idea to not waste food. But there are plenty of charities that are crying out for end of day foods for homeless people. There are plenty of people going hungry every day.

"Went to collect my first ever order. Took a shopping bag in with me which turned out to be a stupid idea as the amount of food i received was packed in a massive box. I shared with my daughter in law, vegetables which made lots of soup, fruits which were used for smoothies and salad which was chopped to add to meals. Fantastic amount of food!!!",5,Google,2021-08-16
My first and second pick up was great. The third didn't go as planned. The person at the counter had no idea what I was talking about and quickly sent me on my way. It would be nice if all employees knew about the orders. It was very embarrassing to go into the business and get turned away because they didn't know about their own participation. I quickly left with eyes on me. So embarrassing,3,Google,2021-08-16

Great idea but not very successful at the moment. Unfortunately 3 out 4 times we've paid and reserved a magic bag (sometimes the night before) then get to the shop and there is nothing. Wasted journey. Waste of fuel to make the extra journey.,2,Google,2021-08-14
Wonderful idea. Excellent value. But a very limited range of shops.,4,Google,2021-08-14
Food options were great BUT the vendor stated that he is still waiting on payment from the company 2 weeks after the agreed upon 3 month delay! Used this app to get a deal and also do something beneficial...not sure it is that good for small businesses at all.,3,Google,2021-08-14

"Would be a great app if all stores actually did have the magic bags. I've noticed one in particular, Greggs , it never has them as they're always sold out. It just looks like free advertising on the app. How is this monitored so the app is actually doing what it was intended for? It would be good if I could feedback on the app itself too rather than Playstore.",1,Google,2021-08-14

TooGoodToGo is the best app I have in my arsenal of apps. They keep me updated on food available in my area. The app is extremely easy and they give you different ways to pay. I love TooGoodToGo ‚ù§Ô∏è keep up the good work!!!! Alicia H,5,Google,2021-08-14
good app! just be careful which businesses you buy from. if it's not one that would have leftover food the end of the day or it's at a weird time then it's probably not operating in the spirit of the app,4,Google,2021-08-13

My first time using the app but the staff at Greggs were fantastic. Very friendly and helpful.,5,Google,2021-08-13
"What took me so long to use TooGoodToGo? fantastic idea for those of us who hate the idea of wasted food. And you get a great bargain as well, usually around 1/4 of standard RRP. I just got 2 full baguette sandwiches along with 2 pastries for 3.99 - barely 1 euro each when the normal price would have been 12 Euros total ! I recommend this app in a heartbeat !",5,Google,2021-08-13

"Their website offers no information about how the app works or any examples of what you'll get, much less the absolutely critical information about where the app can actually do anything at all! Meanwhile, the play store doesn't allow you to sort app reviews by rating, making it also completely worthless as a guide. If you're getting this app it's Not going to be because you have reason to believe it's any good.",1,Google,2021-08-13
"Love the concept, love the UX, love the cheap tasty food. I wish support responded faster, but I understand that the team is small and has more important things to focus on. I highly recommend this app, nonetheless. Keep going guys, don't abandon the mission of saving food from being wasted. It's super cool.",5,Google,2021-08-13
great,5,Google,2021-08-13
"At first, I thought it was gonna be some cheap thing like a small discount on a little food but, no. I was surprised. It's totally worth it",5,Google,2021-08-13
"I looove the idea behind the app and I hope that soon, more stores and restaurants will participate. But there is one big thing I miss: I wish I would get notifications whenever one of my favourite stores uploads a magic box. Otherwise one has to look into the app thousands of times during the day to not miss a good offer..",4,Google,2021-08-13
"Lousy ¬£4 ""magic bag"" from M&S Ely full of marked down leftover disparate items. Bacon and chicken salad made me sick. App reimbursed me ( thankyou x ) but it left a nasty taste in my mouth, literally. Only 10.45am now but nothing available anywhere locally. Too hit and miss for me I'm afraid. M&S is just using it to get rid of unsaleables, not good left-overs. There's a difference. I'm not a dustbin.",1,Google,2021-08-13

I honestly don't want too rate or talk about this app too much because it's so good i wanna keep the deals for myself. You get so much food at a steal and you get to me completely surprised and try new things each time. Unreal.,5,Google,2021-08-12
Great idea to save money and save food for going to waste. The only challenge is to reserve quickly as the best deals don't last long in the app!,5,Google,2021-08-12
Totally unreliable as the consumer cannot cancel his reservation if there is only left less than 2 hours before the collection begins but the restaurants cancel many times the orders at literally the last minute stating there is no more food left.Although the consumer is not charged for this cancelled transaction he is already prejudiced because has already arrived or is on his way to the restaurant just to be informed at the very last moment there is nothing for him.And this is wrong & unfair.,1,Google,2021-08-12

"Really torn with this one. My first experience with a magic bag from Costa was amazing, quickly collected and good value for money. My second experience with Yo Sushi was an absolute disaster as they closed before my collection time even started! Whilst the idea is good, trying to actually get a bag relies heavily on you knowing/memorising the times different stores make their leftovers available, otherwise you'll need to spend more time than it's worth constantly on the app refreshing it.",3,Google,2021-08-10

"Used the app a few times. Really good experience food and caf√©s diversity wise. The app's notifications are attrocious though. You have to check every half an hour to actually find something, otherwise you miss out. Times they advertise the bags keep changing as well. Very frustrating and user unfriendly. I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the concept behind it. Also, if you pay the night before, why wait to collect until the following day late afternoon, food can go off by then?!",3,Google,2021-08-10

The service that this app provides is great, and if the restaurant owners/employees are polite and know how the whole system works, it's a great experience.

After a breakdown of how much we spent on the food that we got, adding the time looking for the food and driving out to get the food in these different locations, just to have the food be end of day food and not good, made this whole experience a waste of our time and money.

Great concept+poor execution=near worthless. The minimum distance you can set from your locations is 2 miles. That is well above walking distance for most people. You can't sort by distance apparently and nothing is available remotely close by. Looking at the offers not much seems to be available is San Francisco period. Then there are hidden stores that are only available if you have a code. The app claims it is not in control of that on their own platform. Ridiculous.,2,Google,2021-07-29

One improvement: while I understand establishments can't provide assurance of what will be left at the end of the day in advance, giving them the option to inform/update the customer of possible allergens (or lack there of) on some of their surprise bags (once these are known) would be greatly appreciated. Some of us want to help end food waste but unfortunately have dietary restrictions due to medical reasons. Specifically, gluten-free options would be most greatly appreciated.",4,Google,2021-07-28

Not a bad idea what they are trying to do but you have more chance winning money on the lottery than managing to buy a bag off here. You have to look at the app evey 5 mins and sometime it just says sold out at a certain time when you have been watching it all day so doesn't work that well. Be a good idea if you could get a notification when something is added so you might get a chance of grabbing one.,2,Google,2021-07-28

This shouldn't be hard to implement and its really about time!,4,Google,2021-07-13
Love this app. I love that the price of the food. It is good quality and it's a great idea. Unfortunately not food goes to shelters and is wasted so this will help eliminate that. I hope the app grows and it would benefit more. Plus shelters always have food and I had supported those but reality of that is that the homelessness did not want it. I had experience with this. I brought the food for a man and he throw it out requested money only. So yeah this app is helping truly eliminate foodwaste,5,Google,2021-07-13

App offers are hit and miss. The local Greggs offers are good value normally but have had a problem when arriving at one store to find it had been closed all day. I was refunded but wasted time and fuel. Finally tonight after weeks of trying I managed to order from Toby Carvery. Then 15 minutes after ordering I got an email cancelling as they had no food left. Very odd as my order was for tomorrow. They must have a crystal ball to predict that one.,3,Google,2021-07-02

( even though there was a basket full of reduced items at the till) so ended up leaving with nothing and walking back home for another 30 minutes.since then its put me off even wanting to continue with this app. its just head work the majority of the time and it just doesnt seem worth the hassle.",2,Google,2021-06-28
If you haven't got or heard about this app please get it as there is a wide variety and selection offers that is available and for the cost of your goody bag it is well worth your time to see what is available from a number of shops that the app offers so give it a try and you won't be disappointed cheers for looking at the comments I've wrote and hope you enjoy if you do get anything from the togoodtogo app,5,Google,2021-06-28

Refound this app as seeing before.. Downloaded and was not until I was deleting apps for storage on my phone I noticed again.. My first buy.. Greggs.. I only have to cross a large grass Area from my home to collect.. I was excited to collect my magic bag of goodies.. Super impressed and lots of food and treats for only 2.59 I uploaded it as my first purchase on Facebook.. Turns out some of my friends use it.. Some had thought and now buying their own too after seeing mine.. Best idea ever.. X,5,Google,2021-06-25

"I've been a member of TgTg since it started and it's taken some hard work for them to get retailers and restaurants on board with selling items that would normally be thrown away. Pub grub, groceries, cafes, bakeries, garden centres and restaurants are all providing food cost effectively and reducing their carbon footprint too. You have to be quick, magic bags are limited, some are better than others, you never know what you'll get day to day. Always worth a try.",5,Google,2021-06-24

When you get something from a bakery that is HARD I doubt at that point it should be consumed. I felt like a homeless person who got a stale piece of cake. I paid to feel homeless.

"Good idea but needs work - I have a lot of places near me that show as sold out but with the same timestamp every day. I've ordered three times, and twice had my order cancelled because they don't have the stock to make the bags.

The app itself is great. Apart from supermarkets and bakeries I don't feel I am trusting some of the restaurants on this app local to me. It's not food that would otherwise be not used etc. 1st time I used the app I paid ¬£4.50 twice for two bags. I got two takeaway cartons of plain rice with two chicken wings in each portion. Not worth ¬£4.50 firstly and secondly not something that seems genuine. Staying curious for now.,2,Google,2021-06-17

This app is so good. You can easily find deals close to you by adjusting the distance. Lots of places to chose and good prices. I've used it twice in one day.

It's well worth the price and you can receive badges etc. I personally really enjoy this because you can get food cheaper and it's a magic bag meaning you don't know what you're going to get and it's always a surprise.

The idea is really great. Unfortunately stores use it to sell you a magic box which is more expensive compared when you buy it regularly. For example you want some flowers you'll get a magic box for 9.90 expecting you get probably a flower bucket which isnt fresh anymore but you'll get one rose maybe 2 if you are lucky. Bought today a magic box from Alnatura ( got literally 2 pepperoni's which aren't really useful anymore. Dont waste your money you can get it fresh and cheaper.,1,Google,2021-06-10

"Not great. I first tried an order with the spar which was more than satisfying. I then tried starbucks the following day and I feel as that I just about got my moneys worth. On the third day I ordered from morrisons @¬£3.09 and my actual food value was ¬£2.51. Maybe I am misunderstanding something, but I feel that as I start to purchase more the winnings get low. reminds me of a bookmakers. C'est la vie",3,Google,2021-06-08

"I thought the YouTube vids were indorsed ads but when I say the amount of food I got for ¬£3.50 God bless you for coming up with this idea. I've worked in some really nice restaurants and regardless of how expensive the food is there's always waste and restrictions on giving it away. I had enough food to share with 2 mates and still have some left! Will be using a lot more often,I wish I knew about the app sooner",5,Google,2021-06-08
such a good initiative to save food from being wasted. it's a win-win situation where food doesn't get wasted and we get more for our money. easy to use app. great customer service even if you have problems (which is very rare). wish there were more restaurants and bakeries participating cause we have to usually drive to pick food up. would be nice to have more option at walkable distance.,4,Google,2021-06-08

First impressions were the staff at Heidi in the Royal Station in Windsor being friendly acknowledging me when I entered the shop. Next some items were selected & my order no. was checked before handing the goods over. Got home to learn that I had three pastries & a square slice of pizza.

Det v√¶rste for mig er at jeg har set at de udl√∏bet varer var ogs√• markeret med en tilbud pris p√•, som er mindre end det man selv betaler for en p√∏se. Det betyder at det vil have kostet mig mindre hvis jeg havde k√∏bt de samme varer fra butikken INDEN de var udl√∏bet...

"Good idea in principle, but you need to be in the right place for it to work. It seems that there are very few restaurants near me that have subscribed, so there is very little to choose from.

They keep your information for 5 years AFTER you close your account with them. I would have signed up if they removed your information the moment you close the account. Shame really,2,Google,2021-05-29
Great idea! but not enough retailers in my area know about it. Is a great app for those who live in London. Will keep it and try it when I visit London one day. The one shop I have found in my area was very quick process. The app is very easy to use. As I say just need more retailers in my area to use the app.,4,Google,2021-05-29
"Last order I had, I ended up throwing away about two thirds of it, as they were items I didn't like. I've literally kept them in the fridge for about a month, before I've thrown them as they've now gone off. It's good value, but only if you like the items and will actually eat them. Otherwise it's a waste of time and money. It's a noble idea, but realistically, unless you can specify what you want or the restaurant start to list what's in the various bags, it's completely hit and miss.",1,Google,2021-05-29

"It's Just OK, not in our city..The app, does not offer ways to see which cities are actively participating. You have to put in your city and expand from there to keep searching. If the creator adds this minor detail, it might be a better app, maybe even 2 1/2 stars",1,Google,2021-05-29

"Great concept but please, please make it more vegetarian friendly. Many restaurants would be happy and able to provide a veggie surprise bag but there's no way of letting them know through the app that you would like one, the only thing you can do is give them a call. Maybe add an option for places that can provide veggie surprise bags, to have a box that the customer can tick while purchasing the bag?",4,Google,2021-05-28

"I just downloaded the app (5/24/21)...thinking that fastfood,local grocery stores which normally throw away food at the end of the day,were the active participants. My desire is to give the useable Leftovers to people in the community especially the Homeless.

"Don't be mislead I thought on this app you purchase a meal then the food they can't sell that they throw away would be randomly given in their ""suprise bag"". This only has the old food and its the same price you would pay for an actual meal! The prices reflect this is about money and not sustainability if they wanted to do that the prices would be discounted or maybe even free but you pay a subscription.

Most of the places are just using it to bump their sales. And the app does nothing about the quality /quantity.

"When you have to preorder from previous day is only natural to miss a 1-2 hour pick up time without any notification. And although store is open, thefood is thrown away even after 15mins of pick-up time loss. I don't understand how this helps with food waste.

I find the App a bit frustrating as I see it click reserve immediately then it comes up with amount so I click 1 and it comes up none left. It does this all the time and even at times it says check back later then goes straight to sold out....,3,Google,2021-05-08

fantastic app üëè love the idea of being able to save food so it doesn't get wasted and more than happy to do my part to stop food going to waste,5,Google,2021-05-08
"The idea is not bad, but how comes it's possible for stores to sell items for the next day? How do they know already a day in advance that they have 5 portions leftovers a day ahead? That means they would need to put 5 portions aside for too good to go customers instead for regular customers or prepare extra 5 portions... That makes no sense... They should be only able to put in a few hours before closing that they have food left not a day in advance.",3,Google,2021-05-08

Good Idea in principle but too many people know about it now. Obviously too many people in my area waiting at specific times for the more desirable shops as they sell out without seemingly even being listed as available.

"Customers can delete an order TWO hours before the collection time. If you miss it, you don't receive a refund. And, as one shop stated, they didn't even receive the money. So where did the money go? Another point is that the shops, however, can cancel your order even few minutes before collection, which is very unpleaseant. Mostly, I think it is not inclusive, people with different diets are always left out. We are trying to rescue food, but if I can't eat, it is useless and a waste of money.",1,Google,2021-05-06

"Tried it 3 times, mixed experiences. Love the idea though. Store 1 - great value, more than expected! Store 2 - less value.

The few shops in my area seem to be constantly sold out, to the point I'm not sure if they're even updating at all.

Ok app. Had quite a few good things right up until I hit favourites. Since I done that they don't show. Now all I get is 'you've just missed this' wouldn't of missed it if it was top of the page though. Only just noticed that you have to scroll right down to the bottom. Plus not enough options in Hull. Which isn't the apps fault. Also they the ones that are available are always super late pick up times.,3,Google,2021-04-29

"Fantastic app! We've had some amazing food, some from places we would not have though of going too, which we have then returned to and bought from at full price. We've bought and donated some of the bags to a local charity too. Great way to stop food waste. The app works well and is easy to use. I wish more companies were registered. Obviously with lock down and closures there are less places open on the app. Also a no meat option box is needed. We donated the meat bags we got to the foodbank.",5,Google,2021-04-29

"Food is rarely fresh and there's a reason why it's being thrown out at the end of the day. No one wanted to buy it!

"I downloaded the app less than 5min after I read about the company. The idea is great but not sure about the execution. I reserved 3 bags from 3 different places, and in 2 of them I had to wait for them to prepare (cook) the contents of my surprise bag. For both places I had to wait 15+ minutes for the 'leftovers' and in 1 of them I had to explain 3 times, to 2 different people what Too Good To Go was in order to be helped. I know it's a new concept but theres a long way to go.",3,Google,2021-04-26
This app steals your information and Google account user/password. Don't bother using this fake app. I'm not sure how many of these are fake reviews but I tried it myself and there were no search results even 50miles from my location AND I LIVE IN LA WHERE THERE ARE TONS OF RESTAURANTS!

Love the idea of this app and did my first collect today. My only criticism would be to be about to filter nearest first or for you to add a only with 1km option as at the moment it's on 3km and I'm getting alot of results for places I'm no where near. Fix this and will happily give 5 stars.,3,Google,2021-04-25

"Anything that tries to save food is a good thing so I can't give this app less than 3 stars. But it used to be better. Nowadays the majority of suppliers will save time on writing what's available by listing it as a 'surprise' or 'magic bag', which is unhelpful if you're veggie/vegan/GF or have any other sort of dietary requirement (so A LOT of people) because you have no idea if you can eat the thing until you've travelled there to find out. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",3,Google,2021-04-18

"A good idea that needs work. The dietary preference part of it needs to be sorted out: If, for instance, you choose ""vegetarian,"" as an option, nothing will be available for my area, which is absurd.

App itself is great. I did try multiple places for consecutive days to evaluate consistency and quality of the bags. If you want consistent quality and good amount of food - go with big chain shops. If you feel adventurous - try independent brands. Smaller shops tend to be hit or miss (regarding amount and value) but it did ocassionally offer some unusual items that turned out to be a pleasant surprise.,5,Google,2021-04-09

"Your experience may vary depending on where you live/use the app. The concept is great, saving food and money. Yet, some merchant's take advantage of it to sell you trash, rotten and expired food. If you see any merchant with 5+ orders left, they're probably making this app a business, ordering from them is not worth it and going against the founding principle of the app. They call orders mystery boxes and while I understand the concept, using this mystery to be sold bad items/food - not OK.",2,Google,2021-04-05

"I ordered 2 bags from Greggs, and I was not disappointed!",5,Google,2021-03-28
"This was originally a 5 star review. The idea is great, but the stores in my area do little but rip people off using the app. Imagine paying for groceries, receiving less than what you paid for and half of it is moldy. You would not tolerate this in any grocer, so why should you tolerate it through this app? There is no such thing as a refund. Several times I have wanted one, but I have never received it. Contacting the staff and sending them photos of the items you received does nothing. Every now and then you can get a good deal... this is becoming an increasingly rare event. Frustration grows with every disappointment. Most of the time you will receive a bag of decent looking fruits and vegetables. However, whatever fresh-ish food you receive has been purposely placed on top to disguise the rotten fruit hiding in the bottom of the bag. Think mold. Imagine leaky, foul smelling food that should've never been placed in the bag, let alone next to whichever good stuff you happened to receive. Boycott the app. Until they allow for refunds and hold stores accountable.",1,Google,2021-03-28

But if you do manage to get one then its pot luck. sometimes you can get really good things and sometimes not. my local corner shop do let me call about 2 hours before pick up to ask what I'm getting and if I dont like it then I can politely decline and cancel the order which I love as sometimes it's not worth, it like 2 packets of leeks and tomatoes",3,Google,2021-03-28
Please introduze like universal packages that can be reused among all subscribed restaurants or something cause this produces a lot of waste of throw-out packages every time I pick something up. This is not sustainable. Just for this reason I restrain myself for using the app more often. Restaurants are not flexible enough if y bring your own package from home. Probably you could enable a chat with them prior to the pick up to let them know we will bring our own box.,4,Google,2021-03-28

"Amazing Lemon Cake. I never buy lemon cakes as I find the lemon taste to sour and overpowering but after today I have been converted to this particular one. Would definitely recommend it. The shop is small and beautiful. The icing on the cake is amazing and personally the highlight for me, not too sweet and not overpowering in the lemon flavour. Would love to try other cake flavours from this shop.",5,Google,2021-03-24

"Op zich houd ik van de app, maar ze moeten dringend de recensieopties verbeteren. Ik wou twee sterren geven aan een warenhuis dat ik net heb bezocht. Daarna bleek dat ik die lage score gegeven had aan een warenhuis dat ik vorige week had bezocht. Maar nu kan ik die score blijkbaar niet meer aanpassen. Bovendien is er geen optie om mijn negatieve score te motiveren: met de combinatie suikerbrood, plakjes lunchworst, 170g Maredsouskaas √©n roomhoorntjes kan ik natuurlijk n√≠√©t ""een maaltijd redden"".",3,Google,2021-03-24

Loved my bag of goodies ..Thank you,5,Google,2021-03-24
Initially I gave them 5 stars. Dropped it to 3 stars because I kept trying to pick up orders from stores that were closed. The voucher codes they gave me didn't work and then customer service made me feel like a liar since I was disputing that the codes were not working. If they had not bothered to give me the broken free vouchers it would still be a 5 star app. I don't really care about the loss of 5 bucks because the food value is outstanding. I'm annoyed though at my interaction with customer service and so that's why it's now 3 stars.,3,Google,2021-03-24
"A superb idea, but in the real world it doesn't work.. Paid a fiver and got couple muffins and some bread ends. There was 10+ bags waiting to be collected so the store was selling old food and keeping a hefty profit margin.. I'm sure this won't be the same for all..",1,Google,2021-03-24

"Decided to give it chance and got given food that had actually gone off and inedible. No replies to messages in the app. No option for a refund or complaints just keep getting told ""it's a magic bag blah blah blah"" and it always leads me back to FAQ. This is anti consumer. Don't risk it you more likely you won't get those big bargains that you see the ""influencers"" and reviewers claim to be getting.

"I have been using it for a year now, In Belgium, It's amazing!! I save so much money and food!! But it¬¥s important to know that only places with 4 stars will give good food every time, there are other places which could give you much or things that you might find unuseful, like the difference between going to a sueprmarket and getting a lot of sandwiches, yogurt, cheese, soup, meat etc, or just 2 big cakes ^^",5,Google,2021-03-23

"Absolute scam. Keeps cancelling orders on me, there's maybe a 10% chance that when you order a bag it actually exists and despite going to the customer service multiple times over this, they don't actually bother doing anything to help. It's a lovely idea, just a shame that there don't seem to be any restaurants participating in the program and nobody checking whether or not the food bags actually exist beforehand.

My third and LAST order was from Salchi-taco. I placed and paid for two orders. I got there 10 minutes before closing and the guy handed me a pizza box with 4 slices of pizza. I asked if that was it for the two orders I had paid for. He said yes. The cheese was hard and dried so I had to throw it out. The next day I contacted customer service via email to ask that one of my two orders be cancel but they refused because I was not able to sent them a picture.

There's not a lot of options around where I live, but the few places that use this app give out a decent amount of food, and sometimes its not even past its sell by maybe just slightly open or something. The app is super easy to use, but the only complaint I have is that I dont get notifications when bags go up, not sure of that is just how it works or if it is something to do with android/Samsung.",4,Google,2021-03-11

I like this app their customer service is very good. App is easy to use. My only grumble is some of the businesses on here short change you & don't give what you pay for. I have used the app several times all for Toby Carvery (2 locations) & Wickid Chicken. Had bad experiences at all. Too Good To Go offer either full or partial refunds but the problem is never resolved with the business selling. The collection times can only be a window of 15 mins & if you miss that window you lose your money.,5,Google,2021-03-05
"After my first request was cancelled and my payment refunded, I didn't hold much hope for this scheme. Until last night when I got my first MAGIC BAG!

Awful experience. Bought pack for 5‚Ç¨ that should be worth 15‚Ç¨. That is why you don't get the chance to choose. Got less than 5‚Ç¨ of food and it was so raw i couldn't eat it and i am not picky. Evaluated the experience so others could know but it wasn't published. Only good reviews are published. The idea is good but in my case it didn't work. Avoid.,1,Google,2021-03-04

Nella mia citt√†, come in molte altre, gli avanzi vanno spesso dati alle mense dei poveri. Se questo mezzo prende piede, si andr√† a togliergli una buona parte del cibo che viene dato loro (gratis).

It is a great app to reduce food waste. There are a few negative things though. The restaurants have the ability to cancel with little notice.

Worth giving it a go. I'd recommend buying from at least 4 shops to determine which one to keep going back to. Not all shops give good items.

I shopped at 4 shops and found one that I'll certainly be going back to every time as they put thought into the stuff they give. Great app overall,5,Google,2021-02-16

first bag was awesome. definitely worth the money but now it's so hard to get a bag. I end up having a quick look and everywhere sold out bar a few places which are too far as I don't drive.,4,Google,2021-02-01

It's great app let's you find food that would go to waste at affordable price you get to pick area and different selection of food however just for me downside is you collect food when shop is shutting so it doesn't get wasted as some of the shops shut too late for me to collect,4,Google,2021-01-31
As soon as I downloaded this app someone has had access to my YouTube account and kept putting videos in my watch history. I don't appreciate that and this app broke my trust. Never again will I click on an ad from instagram and install an app.,1,Google,2021-01-31

"Great idea; doesn't work in practice. Maybe it's just because there are no participating businesses where I live, but this felt like a complete waste of time. I regularly got notifications saying ""food near you needs saving"" but even when I clicked immediately, there'd be zero offers. Also found it really hard to understand the app: for example, things would be listed with future times, but say ""you just missed it"". Not worth keeping the app on my phone.",2,Google,2021-01-24

Excellent results for the food I have collected what really surprised me was not just the quality and quantity but the way we have been conditioned to accept ripe Juicy fruit is already rotten to the bin it goes or if apps similar to this one didn't exist that food certainly wouldn't find its way to the homeless or the poor. Tragic why can't we lodge an interest for the next day or evening and get a notification as it goes live I am always miss thibgs,5,Google,2021-01-23

"Reducing food waste an excellent objective. But can be improved a little. The search criteria should be reduced to allow for walkability. As pick up times can be very specific, it would be good to be able to search for places closeby, less than a quarter of a mile to my location. Even a half mile walk can equate to about 30 minutes to and fro, which isn't great for a work or school day.

"The idea and intent of the app seems good. However, it is being misused by many restaurants and grocery stores to get rid of their stale and expired goods. I ended up visiting the doctor for two stomach episodes in the span of a week of using this app. Additionally, their customer support is very disrespectful and skeptic. They disregard alarming health concerns of users with very derogatory responses after several days. It shows their lack of concern for users and selfish motives of adoption",1,Google,2021-01-22

This way of dealing with waste actually wastes one's time, I may be getting a bargain but I pay back, desproportionally, with time wasted on non existent food.

"The thought of the app is good but the food is totally rip off. Shops and restaurants must be monitored often to see what they are packing for customers üôÑ. I wish I can share pictures to see what I got from Ibis Hotel Manchester UK. This is not saving food but rather scam. With my money I will go to supermarket and get better food for myself..

"It's still 5 stars for me, but after a while, a restaurant where I used to purchase magic bags every now and then, at some point gets sold out all magic bags available right after getting new ones.

Meal cancelled before I got there but never showed as cancelled on app. A text would be better here as they often get through in poor service areas where data won't work. New year's dinner booked and no access when we got there. What it's costing in fuel for meals cancels any price benefit & despite it's obvious green advantages some places treat you as if they're doing you a favour.

Waste of time and money. Shops change the posted pick up time and then they are not even open. The app takes your money when you make the reservation and there is noone on customer service only automated messages that are one way telling you that it might take a few days for someone to get back to you and in the mean time your money is gone and your time Gone. App name should be TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE So far I'm convinced that this is a scam .,1,Google,2020-12-31

"This is a great app. I've gotten good food from restaurants I normally wouldn't have gone to and for a cheaper cost. Things keeping it from 5 stars: -unable to limit distance to 1 mile, 2 miles is the current minimum -no ability to download an event planner so I can save it in my calendar -no way to limit food by allergies.

Hunger and wasted food is another big social and economic issue for humanity to consider.

In just a 3/4 block radius there are 4 supermarkets, 7 fast food spots, at least 10 independent restaurants/bars/cafes and quite a few deli's nearby, yet when I do a full 2 or 3 mile search with this app, I only get a handful of choices!? Great concept, but feels incomplete with such limited choices. App is also very basic setup with no option to see what type of food/cuisine a place has. Also can't see reviews in app!

"Can't see that this is anything other than a scam. There don't seem to be any checks on participants. I paid for my food and arrived 5 minutes into my 90 minute window, to be told the place was closed. There was no food. Then an hour later I still got an invoice confirming payment.

I downloaded this app and realized that we can't comment to let the restaurants know our limitations. We are pescitarian and don't eat meat and certain seafood.

Like playing roulette with this app. It doesn't seem like they have a good relationship with their partners bc I've bought from 1 place. Got there hungry for it to be closed. I still got charged for it. 2nd time I bought had to refund me bc they magically ran out of stuff or wasn't updated. And both these places got 100% of these people gave them 4 out 5 stars on the app. I don't know if other locations honor this amazing concept that's why it might be like roulette.,1,Google,2020-12-18

"Love the initiative and the process went very smooth. Would recommend. BUT there is one down side and it's a very big one for my household. There is no option to communicate allergies. My partner is allergic to nuts and peanuts and buying a magic box is a huge risk. Magic boxes are the only thing I find on the app. Maybe being able to add a comment to the store would help, so they at least be able to pack it in a separate bag and no cross contamination would happen. If fixed, 5 stars for sure!",3,Google,2020-12-17

I really like this app and what it stands for and tries to do out there in our community's. I must be honest I have had it downloaded for quite a few months but due to things like furlough etc it can be hard to find eateries close by to myself (& I have mobility issues). Some of the deals advertised look great and well worth the few ¬£ fee to book yourself a magic bag. I'm more than sure this app has helped out many people currently struggling. Hopefully I'll upgrade to 5* once I utilize the app.,3,Google,2020-12-16

"It's a good idea but executed poorly. They should allow people to have the option to pay in person as restaurants or markets can close early and you'll never get a refund back.

"Tried the app four times, at a different establishment on each occasion, to reserve a dinner meal in the past couple of weeks. Two pick-ups were fine. On a third, the restaurant said, on our arrival, that the order wasn't in the system. On a fourth, the restaurant said, on arrival a mere 5 minutes into the pick-up window, that they were already out of food and flippantly suggested getting a refund from TGTG. TGTG did issue a refund on both occasions, and offered a complimentary voucher once... but not for the second failure. To be left scrambling for dinner at the last minute in New England in late Nov/early Dec, and for TGTG to do nothing about it is less than ideal.",1,Google,2020-12-11

Version 20.11.* is sadly broken on my phone. I don't have google play services so all of the apps functionality that relies on location and map data is broken. Past versions of the app let me view my favourites and make orders. The new version seems to require location data to view favourites so it does not work anymore for me. It would be nice if I could just set the location manually. This would fix the app for phones without google play services.,4,Google,2020-11-29

"Definitely well worth it! Fantastic selection of food items. I had initial doubts using the app for the first time in case it turned out to be a waste of time. But it wasnt! Very easy to set up and use. Being able to choose how far youre prepared to travel doesn't restrict or limit you, therefore you dont miss out on a greater number of shops/stores/restaurants/cafes ect. Being able to buy perfect food items at a fraction of the price and saving it from the bins is awesome. No waste here!",5,Google,2020-11-19

The concept is good. I've used it about 10 times now with mixed experiences (from mountains of delicious food to blank expressions from staff saying that they didn't work with the app!) To make this app truely great there would need to be more quality control to root out the places that don't give what they advertise.,3,Google,2020-11-16
"Good idea, BUT: Many shops canceling their orders on a regular basis, even after the collection time has started. There should be a set limit to do this. Bought food is sometimes ""already gone"", i.e. partially rotten, etc. Half of the app is in English and half in Danish (allow at least the copying the text to translate it). Lack of the possibility to refresh the main page. The notification ""Your food will be ready for collection soon"" is sent 30 minutes after the collection time has started!",2,Google,2020-11-16
"Great app! I'm giving it 4 stars for the only reason that the first two times we went to collect food, one of them was cancelled and the other didn't deliver any bags. The staff said they had another store who delivered TooGoodToGo bags but it was way too far away. The third time was a winner! Thanks a lot for making this possible!",4,Google,2020-11-16

Thank.you so much",1,Google,2020-11-15
Fabulous,5,Google,2020-11-15
"There's no option to get a notification for when a store around you has a magic box available. The app suggests that you manually set a timer around times stores usually have boxes available. This just plain sucks and I have only been able to get a single box this way in three months. I love the idea, I love the design and I want to love the app. But this just doesnt work for me at all. :/",2,Google,2020-11-15

Misleading. Sends push notifications of offers available but there's nothing there when you check the app and also lies about offers missed,2,Google,2020-11-15
"More of the service issue led me to give such a low rating. I decided to try it out and what happened is 3 out of 4 times my order has been canceled. Let's say the pick-up starts at 18.30 and ends at 19:00. I got notification at 18:33 that there is no surplus, which I saw in front of the store. So if you count on this being your dinner, you better not use it. I got burnt enough times. Possible improvement - see stats of how many times people got burnt or a warning that the seller is bad.",1,Google,2020-11-15

App very easy to use. Beyond that I only had 1 good experience out of 3. First place made me a fresh entree cuz they felt bad they didn't have anything leftover. Other 2 places denied any knowledge of being on the app or having my order. Not pleasant having to keep explaining that im here to pick up leftover food. Also not worth for a female walking alone at night which is usually when you must pick up food. Might try again when its more established in US. Til then ramen & food pantry üò¢,2,Google,2020-11-15

"The idea is great and i was enthusiastic at first.

Sometimes the surprise bags are disappointing as there is a lot of possibilities written in the description, but bag may contain only one item and you may not even need it.

"Extremely useful üëç..You will always get a meal or two from the use of food that is wasted from supermarkets and for a few pound ..that's even better ..Food quality is not always what is expected as past sell by and use by dates on a considerable amount of veg and fruit from Morrison s example.The app is easy to use, but not great deal of food businesses on the Wirral opting in .I would still recommend this despite my negative comments as it would be great for people elsewhere",3,Google,2020-10-14

"Good idea but my first order is kind of ordinary. I dont feel as if the person at the counter was expecting me but rather reheated and made one of the meals in about 5 minutes. Its less tackling food waste and more like offering a coupon to get a lottery. Its also not worth it if it is out of your way. I walked around for half an hour until my meal was ""ready"" then waited 5 mins. Food was good though.

"2 weeks in and having an really good time so far. We buy greens, haven't tried stuff from restaurants. There's clearly some skill involved, we need to eat berries fast and lettuce fairly fast. But quite clearly huge value in every bag. Enough value to half the cost of your weekly shopping, if you like greens and are flexible. As students, we would never buy grapes or berries, so it's a huge treat that we are able to do it. My biggest concern is other people finding out the secret üòâüëç",5,Google,2020-10-06
"Used it twice now, once for a delicious Japanese meal and once for a delectable selection of cakes and pastries. Both offered brilliant value for money. Only downside, had to travel quite a way to the restaurants. Can't wait until there are more restaurants near me.",5,Google,2020-10-06

"Too Good To Go is the perfect way of saving money and saving food at the same time! Even if sometimes you don't know what to expect, the few disappointments are outweighed by far by the many times you get great food for low prices. With the right storage (e.g. freezing bread) you get amazing value and a nice variety. And just think: otherwise all that food would just have ended up being thrown away!",5,Google,2020-10-05

"The prices at 1/3 of the original value were delivered on as promised during my usage in early autumn 2020. These savings are not going to be worth the time to get the meal, the scheduling in accordance with the collection times, and accustoming to the predetermined portion sizes for every meal at every store every day; but no one's forcing you to use the app more than your schedule allows for. So I think there are only positives to using the app as long as you are in the right mood for it.",5,Google,2020-10-04
"This is the best app, I'm all about saving food waste and this is a BRILLIANT idea. I've had this app for probably a year or so but at the start there weren't many participating chains in my local area, however after leaving it a while and checking again I was thrilled to see more had joined the fight against food waste.

"Great concept! The app is easy to use and clear. However, I turned up to collect an order the other day and all the food had gone. Apparently the app doesn't communicate to the vendor how many orders they should be expecting. Surely that's an easy fix?! Also, it would be great to minimise search area to 1 or 2km, not current 3km minimum",4,Google,2020-09-28
"Easy to do, good selection of food in the bag.",5,Google,2020-09-28
A great idea with a good choice of food,5,Google,2020-09-27
"More like, too good to be true. I thought the concept would be better. As a mostly vegetarian, the concept don't make any sense since if I get foods I can't eat - they will be wasted anyway (I can't make an app of my own to give them out to friends who might be able to eat them). Better perhaps create categories of popular food restrictions (like ""all"", ""veggie"", ""vegan"", ""pesce"", ""halal"" and so forth). As the app is now, it won't achieve the goal of stopping the waste efficiently.",2,Google,2020-09-27
"Purtroppo devo dare una stella in quanto il primo ordine fatto √® stato cancellato per mancanza di cibo e questo posso comprenderlo dato che comunque me lo hanno detto con 2 ore di preavviso, ma il secondo ordine non ho potuto ritirarlo in quanto il negozio era chiuso nell'orario indicatomi dall'applicazione.

If you're going to use this app, search for local reviews outside of the app support. Again, they don't care about the costumer, only getting shops.",3,Google,2020-09-14

"It really works. If a store doesn't have any surplus or doesn't deliver on its promise after all, you get a refund; no questions asked. Other than that, it just works.

Been using too good to go now for years and its a really great experience usually 4 out of 5 times. No matter how much you use a store you will still get the same thousand mile stare from the server when you show them your phone and the reclaim voucher. Its a treasure. I think there needs to be an easy way to refund your purchase as well as using e-mail which might as well be snail mail when you have an app. Ive probably had to refund maybe just over 10 orders over the years and its tiresome.,4,Google,2020-09-07

Good concept. Poor execution. You plan your whole day around lunch only to arrive and be told they have run out of food.

"In general MOST positive. There've been some bugs with the app few years ago, but they fixed it quickly and communicated everything very well. Had one time a bad deal, but I've used it a zillion times already in different countries, so one bad catch is still very good/lucky. I mostly recommend going for dinner shops cause usually the food is fresher. When going for bakeries, it was never really good; so can't recommend that.

I think there's some room for improvement: the rating system of the places should be more detailed, both when one's rating one's experience and when reading about other people's experience with the shop. One information I'd like to see about each shop is the care in avoiding excessive plastic waste in packaging food.",4,Google,2020-08-22

"Great app! Love the idea it turned into reality of giving you a chance to save food, and at the same time people like me, who don't have too much money to spend, get amazing baked goods for a very low price! It's a win-win! I really hope though that very rural areas will get the chance of using it as well, there's too little shops that use it so far. I'm lucky that we have one bakery with 4 shops in our area that participate, but other areas still have nothing.",5,Google,2020-08-21
Tolle Idee und auch gute Umsetzung. W√ºrde 5 Sterne geben wenn die App die online Authorisierung des Kaufs √ºber Kreditkarte mitbekommen w√ºrde.

"Don't get me wrong. App is gorgeous, but 90% of the stores use the app to sell normal food at normal price, sometime even higher. I will rate the app 5 stars when restaurant will start to sell remaining food at lower price, which almost no one does!! Example: in my area, with this app, I have to wait the evening to claim at Costa one of more than 10 bags of croissants (x2) for 3¬£. So no surprises.. Lots of bags already prepared. High price. This is clearly not what I was expecting from the app.",1,Google,2020-08-08

Everything from lasagna, vegetables, salads, pasta, just everything that's leftover from a supermarket you can get. Again, it will depend on your local shops, but I'm extremely lucky with one, that always have 5 packages left over to buy. If you can't eat it right away, put it in the freezer.

Pickup is only after 19:00, so most of us Dutchies have a full belly. And I got raw fish, meat, cheese and dairy that could only be used the same day.

But the idea and app are great and I'll be sure to order eventually!",4,Google,2020-07-08
"Very good concept, the idea behind and the motivational messages are great! The layout and usability of the app is well done, too.

"I've had this app for months now and unless you live in a city, I cant recommend it; there's next to nothing in rural areas. Getting a box is also a pain, as they're supposed to be available at the end of the advertised collection time but you'll refresh the page for 10 mins only for it to sell out instantly. OR it allows you to snag something, pay for it and then refunds you because it didnt actually exist.

That's the awesome part of the app though, reducing waste while discovering new restaurants and shops!

"Cool concept, app could use some work. Currently, a lot of stores have an available listing of ""Nothing available today"". It would be neat to be able to filter those out as well, so you get a more comprehensive overview of the available options for that day. Also, the rating system doesn't tell you much. It'd be better to see what % of people rated the store on the various categories. Much more transparant than ""80% gave 3* or higher"".",4,Google,2020-05-21

"Good app, simple to use, but the latest version is giving me some issues: sometimes the app won't start and sometimes I don't see new offers. And there is this very annoying popup telling me there are 'Only a few left!'; please remove this as I don't want to tap every time to remove it from the screen; it's taking up half the screen - very, very annoying!!! And also I don't get a notification if my favorite stores have new offers, this is something very useful as I don't want to look at my phone all the time.

"Due to pandemic, suppose there is less waste due to more food shops being closed, so less choice. Caught a food shop clearly on the app for self promotion w/out actually providing the goods. That is, declaring food offer as 'missed' when it wasn't offered in the first place. Dodgy! Saying that, the quality of the food is good with friendly service in these fretful times. The app is user friendly too - simply and easy to nativigate, not too preachy or overly pious in content. Would recommend.",3,Google,2020-05-04

"Love this app. Tried lots of new food, received lots of bargains, a couple of restaurants didn't give their suggested values but were still cheaper. The only downside - you will save ¬£s but you might add on pounds :S Would be great if we could choose the order of offers (eg put earliest first). Update - Most suppliers are good or even great. Not so good suppliers just don't show their review synopsis. When they close early without telling you, you can't leave a review to tell people that they are thoughtlessly wasting your time (This even happened to me on Christmas eve, so I was left without bread/sandwiches!) - they can notify you via the app if they have to close early or if no food is left - some just don't bother. At least if a supplier's synopsis says 76 per cent rated their purchase at least 3 out of 5 stars"" you know 24 percent rated their purchase 2 stars or less :S. The app would work better if all reviews of all purchases could be seen like with eBay (I think).

This along with a complete absence of any vetting of the stores on the app. Some places are amazing but maybe 1 in every 5 stores are atrocious service and on 2 occasions stores have tried to scam me (they're still on the app BTW). At this point I only occasionally use it and only ever big chains which sucks because I want to shop local.,2,Google,2020-03-25

Just a great idea! It's great to get deliciois food for a good price! And it's even greater to rescue the food from being wasted!

"It used to be good. But now I;m tired of going to places to pick up meals that aren't there & the inconvenience of trying to get a refund when they change the pick up time & the notification doesn't appear - leaving me paying for what I never got. Combine that with chancers who considering pouring a sauce over kitchen waste, makes it OK to be sold cheaply, The establishments that treat you as something in off the street as you are buying ""waste food"", or those who come nowhere near the value of what you are meant to be buying They are on their last chance. Probably in more ways than one, as when you get buffet food at the end of the day, everyone is touching the same servers, which presently just isn't on",1,Google,2020-03-21

We would all do well to consider what we might otherwise neglect and fail to love as we should.

"I love this app so much. If you're thinking about getting it then DO IT! You can get a whole bag full of great food with barely any money spent. I actually love not knowing what I'm going to get, it's like opening up a present, and it has allowed me to try new foods. The pickups take less than a minute. Absolutely no faults. Looking forward to when more businesses catch on to this app and start selling, though I have lots of choice already, more would be great! Plus the app has no ads!",5,Google,2020-03-09

A bit nervous of using app/going to get food at first but now I love it! Minimizing waste is brilliant and some stuff (bread/cake) can be frozen.

Only 2 businesses are using this app. No filter for distance in List - why do I have suggestions in the next city over 50 miles away? I want a hygiene rating provided as one of the businesses I know has a terrible rating. Terrible selection and uptake from businesses - massive lack of lunch choices. Overall a waste of time.,1,Google,2020-03-05

"Great idea for an app, and super affordable for me, being a student. The only thing I would say is that it's a shame there's no delivery option (as where I am, some of the places are quite far away) but also I think it'd be great if the app had notification settings so you can set up notifications from your favourited places so that you know when they're available or maybe notified you when you're close to one. It's a great idea for an app tho and I'd really recommend if you're a student too",4,Google,2020-03-04

I just love this app so much!! Fighting food waste by saving food that would otherwise go to wastee... and everything I got was still so nice and fresh. Only improvement in the app i think there must be an option of collect now in this area. Whenever i am looking for something to collect its hard to go to map and then filter the results to get the time to the current time... and otherwise i believe the list structure of the app can be improved.. i find it hard to find places.,5,Google,2020-03-03

It can be frustrating when refreshing favourites: I often see the 'something went wrong' message then miss out on as purchase after restarting the app. Also, the status of vendors can be misleading.

"I have used this app several times now and I have consistently been delighted by the quality and amount of food in my ""magic bag"" wherever I have gone to. I like the idea of preventing perfectly good food going to waste and landfill by the simple expedient of businesses making themselves known as being friendly to this concept so consumers get real bargains of excellent meals for not very much cash.

Best app ever! I would recommend! Especially for students it's a good deal for a good cause. I just discovered it and I use it at least once a week now. I get great food for an affordable price and I help reduce food waste what better could there be. The only point of improvement would be to add a filtering to option like time where you want to pick up and where it would make the process smoother :),5,Google,2020-02-20

This app is simply the best! Getting bargains for less money. Saving a meal that would of ended up in the bin. Yes you have to travel to get the items but it's no different to travelling to the supermarkets where often u get there at the wrong time and it's all abit hit and miss with reduced food there and often u find people taking everything and not caring much for others THIS APP cuts out all that stress and what's more exciting is you dont know what your going to get in your magic bag.,5,Google,2020-02-20

"Don't believe the stars. Buy a pack, turn up and the store is closed. Apparently this happens all the time. Apparently it's ok to waste people's time going to the store. The option to leave a review for the store isn't allowed if the order is cancelled!!",1,Google,2020-02-18
"A retailer can take as many orders as they like, and cancel them. Any cancelled orders can NOT leave customer reviews. So sell 100 packs, but only have 5. Disappoint 95 people who have taken time and trouble to visit the store for it to be closed, who now have no voice to warn others. The 5 who collected goods can leave a review based on their experience. So a store can get 5x5* reviews in one day...which really should be 5x5* + 95x1* Loophole makes this app pointless",1,Google,2020-02-18

Excellent app to use for cheap high quality food that would only have gone it the bin,5,Google,2020-02-17
I feel that customers should be able to to give personal feedback in relation to the different shops/ restaurants/ eateries they have used or experienced. The app does not allow for this as it has a set of options you cannot expand on so does not give us the freedom to fully Express our experiences. Therefore the review is limited and is not a wholly true reflection of our experiences.,3,Google,2020-02-17

"It's a great concept but the app itself could be more user friendly. For example a max distance setting, so the app doesn't suggest shops that are two hours away by car. Edit: no no, there are plenty of shops in my vicinity, that's not the problem, I just wish I could filter out the shops that are in other towns. Also the constant urging to post on social media is kinda annoying.",3,Google,2020-02-16

"The postings for caf√©s , hotels and bars advertised were all appropriately close by for me, and I had a huge decision to make.

Good concept. Hard to use. I have used it twice and one time I had to get a refund as the restaurant was shut when I went to collect. The CS team were helpful though. I also struggle to navigate to foods I want and the location settings are too broad. I keep getting recommendations for pick ups in place 2 hours away from my location. Good idea. Needs work.,3,Google,2020-02-11

"Used for the first time today to buy a breakfast from Novotel, great value. Ok, used it a few times in various supermarkets. Some are ok, but from some - even in the same chain - it seems you're paying them to dispose of rotten, well past display by date fruit and veg (6 or 7 days). It appears some stores are quite cynical. So IMHO it's great for eat now stuff but not so for grocery. It is probably better to go into the store and pick up the reduced items. Still 5 star app though.",5,Google,2020-02-09

Aah and just to let you know, there are people not speaking the local language in many places in the world. Letting them translate something should not be that big a deal.",2,Google,2020-02-08

A great app to save food waste as well as saving money,5,Google,2020-02-05
"Frankly, a complete and utter waste of time. They advertise a box, take your order, take your money and, just before it's time to collect it, they cancel the order and promise a refund in ""up to 10 days"". You can't get much more pointless than that! Too good to go? No, just too good to be true. UPDATE: Too good to go tells me that the order was cancelled because the shop had no available food. So why advertise it in the first place and why confirm an order for something that doesn't exist?",1,Google,2020-02-05

"Waste of time, unless you are willing to be sat looking at a screen on the off chance you are there when the offers become available.

It's such a good idea which helps save the planet by reducing food waste.,4,Google,2020-02-04
No more waste. This app helps you connect local businesses with people that want to fine cheap food that doesn't have a too much shelf life left. It works in an easy way to see the available deals. Today I ordered my first bag and it was interesting the entire experience and the food was decent. I recommend using this app.,5,Google,2020-02-04
"I'm so angry at the places in/around Paris that use this app to make more PROFIT rather than it's INITIAL purpose which is saving food from waste! The quantities you get are nothing compared to the food that's still leftover, which they keep to sell for retail price while it's already old, stale and sometimes rotten. Most sellers seem annoyed that you're there! I've also used the app in Glasgow and have had a great experience 98% of the time! Check who you allow on your app!!!",1,Google,2020-02-04
Think it's a con or just dosn't work for me I don't get notifications and every time I check the local store has sold out as mentioned no notifications what so ever. UPDATE Feb 2020 still nothing keep an eye on the app says between such a time for the next day keep an eye on it and then says Sold out. I'm not in a busy area like the Admin said in the message. I'd love to know other ppls experiences as mine is nothing. And I'd have more luck getting a lunch from the queen,1,Google,2020-02-04

"Het idee achter Too Good To Go steun ik volledig, eten goedkoop aanbieden wat anders weggegooid zou worden. De app zelf vind ik niet altijd even handig in gebruik. Zo heb ik per ongeluk een box bij een andere supermarkt besteld dan waar ik dacht het besteld te hebben. Tegenwoordig let ik dus beter op. Voor mij zou het handiger zijn als ik kon instellen wat mijn eerste scherm zou zijn, de normale, de favorieten of de kaart (die ik zelf het meeste gebruik).

This app is a really good idea. I live and work in London and regularly find places to try. Most places have good quality food and the people in the shops/ cafes very helpful. The only thing i would say it can be a bit up and down if you are vegetarian to judge whether what will be in your bag will be suitable. I have often found it best to go into the location and check but this is not always possible when places run out prior to collection time and you are not in the area - great idea though!,5,Google,2020-02-02

The idea behind the app is great! But it's a pity that you can't input any dietary restrictions or allergies.

The idea is strong. Connect users with food that's reduced in price. Users get a random sample. Businesses make some money and waste is reduced. Problem is that the food is mostly not worth going out your way at a set time as its never the amount that is originally quoted. It's too little food for a little too much money. Would rather just go to the shop,2,Google,2020-01-30

Only issue is that it has become a victim of it's own succes, and many places are trying to turn it into a profitable commercial strategy instead of staying true to the original goal of reducing food waste.

Really good idea. More restaurants should join. There are also fake restaurants they never heard of it like Jimbo's Nottingham. On the other side YO sushi with amazing bags canceling after collection time start which is breach of policy saying customer can cancel 3 hours before restaurant 2 hours. Both you drive for nothing so it is time consuming and co2 polluting. Customer servis always helpful to sort any problem and make a refund.

"I have been using this app in several countries and I find it amazing. No brainer, 5 stars. The concept is a win on all sides: cheap meals for me, small extra revenues for food shops, less food waste in our nature. Could be worth pushing more to reduce packaging (for example small overprice for who does not bring his own box) The UI design is also very good.

"Fantastic to connect to great restaurants with unsold food that we can buy at a low price and to decrease food wastage. Everyone wins.

It's fun to get something tasty and unexpected.",5,Google,2020-01-12
"Idea: 5 stars, Execution: 5 stars. A good tip, is to look at the ratings of the places offering goodie bags. Many places are very reasonable, where you can essentially get a very late (near 22 in the evening) but delicious takeaway meal for 40 kr. Other places, such as Q8, you will get maybe 3-4 dry pieces of bread that nobody would buy willingly, and you save almost nothing off the normal price anyways. And all you do is throw it out because it's barely edible.",5,Google,2020-01-12
Nice idea but impossible to cancel order - it says that the cancel button is in the receipt in the app but it is definitely not - me and 5 friends checked and there was no sign of it. Little unscrupulous IMO,2,Google,2020-01-12

They didn't know I was coming, no bags were ready, when the employee said they had nothing to put in a bag, I said I already bought it, he tried to persuade me to cancel my purchase but that's not possible, then told me that if I didn't collect it the money would go back to my account. Eventually he said he could get some food for me but it wouldn't be a full bag. I said ok, I had come out at night for this and paid for it. I had 4 danish pastries which were ok, 2 packets of fresh fish out of date that evening and smelling bad. 2 sandwiches, both inedible. That was my magic bag!!!!",1,Google,2020-01-09

"Fine app, just one issue. The rating of the stores is confusing, actually misguiding by only showing the positive side. The ratings have also moved from the obvious prominent place in the list to a place where you have to look for them. It was obviously a conscious decision to obscure the ratings since in previous version it was as as it should.",3,Google,2019-12-29
Great way to not waste food! App is easy to use too.,5,Google,2019-12-29
Great app easy to use. Hopefully more companies will sign up in the future to make all this worthwhile. I finally managed to grab a bag for the first time today. I have a feeling it's the same greedy people that know the times these places add the bags as it's absolutely impossible to buy any,5,Google,2019-12-29
"The application works very well. When I went to pick my bag up it was al lready and it took me 2 minutes to get it. There is so much food waste all around the world that makes this entire thing so brilliant. Also so many people begging for money, food on the streets, when you collect something you know that you cannot finish, you can give it to someone needs it on the street. I love this app because it makes me feel like i am doing something good for the world even though it is very tiny.",5,Google,2019-12-29

"Great, easy to use app. BUT if you live in a small town there's hardly any choice, some days none. Also found that a place can be generous with their 'Magic Bag' one day, tight the next. Probably best if you're in a large town or city with a bit of competition. Also found it annoying that a cafe/baker/deli can make an offer, you sign up, but then they cancel at the last minute and there's no alternative offers as it's nearly the end of the day. Would be much better if business' could be tied in or have to offer an alternative once an offer is made.",4,Google,2019-12-27

"Getting a bargain while helping to support local businesses and reduce the amount of food that is wasted sounds too good to be true, so I ignored adverts for this app until I saw my local shops promoting it.

"Allows you to get good food for a lot cheaper than the shops sell, but at a small time window. If a gap in your timetable coinsides with the pick up time of a great restaurant, this is a really good app. App easy to use and clearly lays out time and location of restaurants, but due to its nature of being spare food, the descriptions of what you're getting are a little vague.",5,Google,2019-12-17

"Really clear information on the app. Easy to use. Mostly good deals. The only reason for 4 stars & not 5 is when reporting a problem, the app would not send when photos were attached. A key component of evidencing the issue I was reporting. However it is not clear that 2g2g monitor stores who use it as a way of of getting rid of food rather than saving waste food. Also the rating only shows who rated 3 or more stars. Overall 5 magic bags & v good experiences, bar 1.",4,Google,2019-12-16

There are non profit charity organizations here that are not offering anything to you, they just want your donation! Always read the fine print. Also, sometimes you will get a bag of groceries where one or two items has mold, you should clean everything you get from grocery stores. if the store runs out of food, you can get a refund.",5,Google,2019-12-15

Muy buena idea y espero que la sigan mejorando a√±adiendo establecimientos. Lo que no me gusta y es molesto es que te muestra como cerca sitios que tienes hasta 17km lo que significa que tienes que ir buscando si realmente est√° cerca o no. Ahora con el mapa mejor pero a√∫n as√≠... Ni 9km me parece cerca si tengo que ir a pie.,4,Google,2019-12-13
The app is so poor. It says things so out at a time that hasn't been reached yet. It also asks you to be quick saying there are still options available but when you go to that option it says sold out. You can ring anyone for assistance You fill out a form and get a response perhaps 48 hours later if you do get a response. It is so poor.,1,Google,2019-12-13

"I had great experience with this app and I like it so far, it's simple, easy to use, and where I live (big city) many stores use it. A downside which is unrelated to the app, and hasn't happened to me but to friends, is that shop keepers treat you like a 2nd class customer when you go to collect the bag, being rude and unhelpful. Perhaps the solution is that these shops should opt out of this app if they are not eager to give away soon to be expired food at a portion of it's price?",5,Google,2019-12-09

"TGTG is a revelation. Win-win for restaurants and customers. Allows customers to find an affordable good quality food and try new places, and restaurants to attract new clientele and reduce waste of leftovers. The app is only getting better and better, with hotel breakfasts now included, and store groceries (!) I do however feel guilty about the plastic usage, in particular in restaurants where the portion is pre-packed, but this is very much on case by case, as many use recyclable packaging.",5,Google,2019-12-02

"Ottimo in teoria... in pratica le magic box sono piene di roba cos√¨ scadente che uno si limita a dare un'occhiata e a buttare tutto nella spazzatura.

"The concept of reducing waste is wonderful and this company is useful. The app usually shows deals further than my location, even in another city. How about saving time and fuel or public transport? Do you check if vendors do time to time deals? I believe that they are on the app as an advert. So lack of deals. It is a paradox as it means that they sell or manage well their production. On the other hand, I check regularly my favourite stores and never could buy (no deal or I'm too late üòÇ)",3,Google,2019-12-01

The app is great but I've been waiting months for a reply to an email I sent regarding literature I could print off and hand out to local businesses in my area. Il print and hand out at my own expense. I don't like waste so I'm happy to do my bit for the environment. My nearest participant is 30 miles away. It seems only city centres are targeted and not towns and villages.,3,Google,2019-11-30
Hi Could anybody help me regarding this app? I was wondering if this have notification settings as in if items are available in my chosen local area I will have a notification sent to this device.

First time user. Definitely not the last!,5,Google,2019-11-28
Brilliant app which has encouraged me to try food in places I would never have thought of visiting. Some magic bags are better than others though I've never been disappointed. The fact that using the app helps me to do my bit towards reducing food waste is an added bonus. The only problem is that it's become too popular and it's not always easy to book magic bags!,5,Google,2019-11-28

"Really good app, just needs more shops and businesses to join to make more of a difference. Would be good if it notifies you when your favourite places new deals came available.",4,Google,2019-11-28
It does not save waste it allows large companies to profit from their waste. As they would rather bin it than give it to those in need! Meanwhile those with disposable income can come on and buy it. Food that is going off or approaching a date should be given away for free.,1,Google,2019-11-28

"I thought this app was cool. Then I went to collect a bag and there was no food left. The supermarket didn't swipe to confirm, still I was charged on my card for no food. When I asked for a refund, I was asked why I hadn't picked up any food - despite explicitly saying there was no food left. So BE CAREFUL, they will charge you even if the food seller didn't swipe.

I've been frantically trying to get one of the Morrison's boxes from two different stores near me, but they release them at random times throughout the day and I keep missing them by a few minutes. It's really frustrating and I don't have time to stare at the app all day. Please can you add push notifications when boxes go live!",1,Google,2019-11-27

"The app is pretty good however I still find there is room for improvement in terms of user friendliness especially when it comes to the way collection day/ time windows are organised and the overview can be a bit confusing to navigate. I've used twice at the same hotel breakfast buffet and once at a cafe and so far I was happy on all occasions with the amount, variety and quality of the offering. Some kind of integrated translation service would be great when using the app abroad.",4,Google,2019-11-26

"Ordering and payment was easy. The pickup required a code, which took a bit of finding because it was the first time, but now I know what to look for. I received a big box, which contained lots of fruit, carrots and potatoes, and some crumpets, and gluten free bread. I have relished the challenge of planning meals around, and using all of the items.",5,Google,2019-11-26
The app works as intended (although I would like an option to center in on a city/region on startup without having to let the app use my location) but I think the share that the app takes is far too big - this is clearly not about fighting food waste but about turning a profit ... (if I'm missing something and they are donating (part of) their profits for a good cause I'd be happy to bump the rating up to 5 stars),4,Google,2019-11-26
"The app itself is brilliant, easy to use and complete an order. The idea is great, and the process works. I ordered from a salad bar and didn't receive a box which was not so fun, but did have the choice of any main item which was effectively 50% off",5,Google,2019-11-26

"This app is great in London because so many businesses have signed up. Some of the boxes can be a bit hit and miss but the rating gives you an indication of whether it's wortg a try.

I have only recently joined this group but I have ordered one magic bag from seven stars in Telford and it was amazing. It was lovely hot fresh food and great value.

Awesome app. Such a good thing to do. Lots of food which was supposed to be wasted can be used. Had a breakfast fit for kings from the buffet in an international hotel at the price of a sandwich. Will be doing it mlre often. Feels good to be part of something sustainable. Thanks the developers of this Idea!,5,Google,2019-11-25

Knowing this app from my ex üëÄ, and this probably is the best thing ever in that heartbroken relationship, as this is the only good thing he left to me lmaooüòÇü§ô..when I don't wanna cook, I always bought my meal from this app, and it helps reduce food waste too, so why not, it just too good to go!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5,Google,2019-11-24

"I like using the app, just after the recent update the receipt would not load if you have no mobile internet. And once it's on, the app drags so much data! 4 mb for opening one receipt cause all the non-necessary pictures were loading - it's way to much. Can you make the receipt again working offline?",4,Google,2019-11-24

"Great cause, and a good app once you learn the basics - I totally messed up my first pick up. Couldn't find the place, swiped the collection complete button before collection and almost wasn't given the food as a result. Super confusing on the first go. Doesn't have a search option for the shops, and you'll just have to keep scrolling hoping to find your local shop that you already know is using this service - but once you find it you can add it to favourites which is amazing and fast to use",4,Google,2019-11-23
Good wee app. No issues what so ever!,5,Google,2019-11-23

Best App. Sometimes you get to fine nice places that suits your taste and sometimes no...either way you're saving food!,5,Google,2019-11-23
"Large box of amazing sushi on my first time of trying this app. Very clear instructions about collection times and easy to use. In order to improve it would be helpful to be able to request a preference for gluten free/ vegetarian etc so that you don't get a box full of things you can't, and which then gets wasted (which is against the purpose of this app anyway!) Very happy with first box though.",5,Google,2019-11-23

Great app for a great cause!cheers!,5,Google,2019-11-22
Thank you for an amazing initiative!,5,Google,2019-11-22
"It is good initiative, no doubt but the app is not inclusive for various users. The description of the restaurant is in local language which is fine in principle. However when I contacted support to suggest a possibility for translation to english, they did not help. They asked me to use Google Translate which is also fine for me, but I cannot even select the description text in the app to copy paste in Google Translate. Very bad support.",3,Google,2019-11-22
Good cheap food!!,5,Google,2019-11-22
"Easy fast app, love it!",5,Google,2019-11-22
"A great app for those who care about food waste. Lets you easily find restaurants that sell the leftovers with huge discount, and get good food for a low price. Win win.",5,Google,2019-11-22
"Even when vegetables and fruits are part of the possibilities, the most likely scenario is that you'll get a lot of junk food. Client should be able to define their dietary requirements and be advised when a shop or restaurant has a reasonable chance to provide them with food fitting them. It requires to think a bit harder about the system and more coordination with the businesses taking part in it. I can accept a certain level of unpredictability but buying food shouldn't be a complete random game where you buy a cat in a bag. As inexpensive as it may be, it is still my money and if I pay even a very small amount to get something I don't want or may not eat, it remains too expensive.",2,Google,2019-11-22
"Great App, works well. And the offers to rescue food while saving a buck are truly awesome. So far I made 3 purchases and each of them at different locations had good quality food.",5,Google,2019-11-22

Great app for getting cheap food that otherwise will get thrown away!,5,Google,2019-11-21
Great idea and hope it grows more. Picked up a great carvery for under half the price of going to the restaurant. Plastic container given and I helped myself to carvery food as you normally would.,5,Google,2019-11-21
"Great idea, but annoying that you dont get a time of collection until you pay, I paid expecting to pick up on my way home, a message showed collection in 1 hour 20 mins naturally csnt wait that long, arrived at the store in canary wharf and they sent me to a different one on the other end who sent me back! I cancelled the order request with message twice and no response they still invoiced me! This app would be better of they show the time of collection and allow 5 mins after order to cancel.",2,Google,2019-11-21
Super intuitive app,5,Google,2019-11-21

"Paid for food, received nothing. Arrived at collection time, having driven 20 minutes to be told nothing was left. Why is there no option for the establishment to notify me on the app that there is no food remaining?",1,Google,2019-11-20
"It is a really good app, not only this app is helping save the food also the food is cheaper and fresh. One more thing I am loving is I am getting to know and try different foods from so many shops nearby or when I am in a different town. But I think there should be a food preference option for every shops. As I don't eat pork, I am not quite happy if I get something of pork in my magic bag. Overall, I do recommend the app.üòäüòä",4,Google,2019-11-20

Easy to use and constantly improving.,5,Google,2019-11-20
"I'm obsessed! Cheap, accessible food and helping out the environment? Super excited to see this app grow and hopefully more and more stores will join in. My only regret is that a lot of stores use single-use plastic bags/containers for their food. Would love if there was a system for reusable containers and paper bags.",4,Google,2019-11-20
Great money saver,5,Google,2019-11-20
Best app. Hopefully more retailer's will join. I remember in a coffee shop we had to throw away so much as we couldn't have this kind of app then. Wish we could add a comment for dietary restrictions. Example. No red meat ( beef pork ham lamb),4,Google,2019-11-20

"This is a total con! Made my first order and went to pick up the food and paid 3.59 for 5 small bakery items that supposedly were going to waste and it ends up that I have added up and seems I have paid their retail value! Do not expect to grab a bargain before the food goes to waste, this whole con seems to make you buy items at their retail value and think you are getting a good deal! I will seek to make a formal complaint about this! Dissatisfied and feel like I was ripped off!",1,Google,2019-11-19

My friend went to pick up a goody bag with fresh fruit, pastries and all other breakfast items"" and got couple of slices of bacon and baked beans. It made me laugh. This app is a great idea and I know this kind of concept works great in some other countries, but this doesnt seem very well set up yet.",3,Google,2019-11-19

Fewer businesses on here than hoped. No chance to get a morrisons bag as they sell out within 1 minute of being listed. Would like to get notification messages when local businesses' listings for that day's orders become live / available. Would like businesses to put more guidance on their pages to give you an idea of how much food you are likely to get eg for the pubs to say the purchase is for a small cardboard box with enough food for one person. That way you know how many purchases to buy.,3,Google,2019-11-16

"This is a good app if you go for chain eateries where one knows what one is likely to get in terms of quantity & quality. I do think there are questions over how much carbon is being saved here given that most customers are likely to drive a petrol or diesel car at least a few miles to collect the food that may have quite a small carbon footprint. The latter is especially the case when the food being collected is vegetarian. Cycle, walk or bus there however and you will be reducing CO2 & waste.",3,Google,2019-11-15

"This is a great idea and one of those things you kind of wish less people know about. I say that because as it becomes more popular, getting your magical box of goodies may become more difficult. This is not a negative to the app, just me being greedy! I've bought from two different bakeries and it's worked fine. It really depends where you go, what day and theoretically what the weather was like on the day to determine how much you'd get. Great concept that works. Well done!",5,Google,2019-11-04

"I ordered the food and had a distance to travel for collection, so thought I'd make an afternoon of it. Out of nowhere the order was cancelled, but only after I started my journey. I messaged Too Good and was met with a generic response. Basically, you can book to collect your food, but there's no guarantee you'll receive it due to availability. The issue of availability lies with Too Good and the food providers, not the Too Good customers who want the food. This is such poor service!",1,Google,2019-10-30

"Takeaway time is not clear in the app after making an order. I got a ""You saved a meal"" email even though I didn't pick up the order (The app did not ask me if I did either). The app is in English, but its mindset is very German; not only the concept of saving food, but also the idea that it is obvious that you are responsible to be exactly on time within a narrow timeframe, and the lack of care for how your experience was.Edit:The app crashes. On the bright side, ordering process isquite smooth.",5,Google,2019-10-28
"This is a fantastic concept and the shops do an excellent job on their end.

"The only food waste app that has a broad enough user base to be useful. Operates smoothly.

Idea and great application. But many traders do not play the game in Brussels. A lot consider us to be nothing but nothing and like garbage collectors. By giving us expired products! Or we order veggie and we recrieve only meat. Or a very short time to get the basket (only 15 min for some!) Or too short dates of consumptions (we received 3kg of fish at 21.00 to consume the same day!) So we must throw everything what will not solve the waste. There should have an option to refuse the basket.,2,Google,2019-10-22
"Bad, advertised food is not what it says, for instance global nines say you get ¬£12 worth of food for just over ¬£3 and when I got there it was not what its says. A very small tupperware pot just enough to fill up with some rice and when I asked for another pot I was told it's worth only ¬£3 not ¬£12 worth.

Ok im back two years later and it has taken off! I love it. So good to see so mamy companies reducing waste. First go using it. I arrived at the shop 20mins before stated and they said I was too late and tried to give me something less than what I paid for. (cheapest thing on the menu). Eventually walked away with something after showing what they had put up. Needs alert to collect and a method that payment is only taken on collection.,5,Google,2019-10-17
"The app does not allow any filtering by dietery preferences. For example I just looked at a description for a ""Magic bag"" that starts by suggesting that it will contain either vegetarian or vegan food. Drill down into the description though and it adds that it COULD also contain chicken! So, if you are vegetarian, vegan, Muslim or Jewish you can a get lost. If you have allergies then be very careful (though there is a disclaimer covering them).",2,Google,2019-10-17
"Great app, great concept. Take reviews with a pinch of salt, and separate them into comments on the app Vs comments on the retailers. There's good and bad retailers, beyond the control of the app, and some people rate the app based on their experience with the retailers, which is not helpful to us as retailers vary across geographies. It's helpful to the developers to have words with the retailers, but don't punish the app for things beyond their direct control. Improve feedback system plz",5,Google,2019-10-17

"I love this app and have been using it all around Europe so far! It keeps my food expenses down when I'm on the road and it's easy to use. So far the experience with most shops and restaurants was positive, it takes a bit of trial and error to find out which places give you what kind of food and how much of it and I love the surprise part of it!

"Shame that it is not always possible to write a review to restaurant(besides rating the food itself). Often restaurants state that one could/should bring their own containers, but in reality the meals are already packed by them and ready for pick up. This is not environment friendly and leaves a huge negative impact of using the app/service. Other than that concept, app itself and most of the meals are well organized.",4,Google,2019-10-07

I forgot to get cranberry-I'd recommend taking a small plastic pot for cranberry etc as when home you'll need to microwave it. I took cool box with keep warm function!

"What a great app. Very easy to use, simply click, pay and take your phone into the restaurant and show your receipt. Will be even better when more places sign up for it, but already quite a few in my area. I just had a very filling dinner for ¬£2.50 instead of ¬£7.50. Great!",5,Google,2019-09-26

"This app is exactly what I've been looking for. However I think vegetarian and vegan options should be available. More and more restaurants, cafeterias ect have such option available, so at the end of the day, they can give them up as well. I'm vegan, however while saving a meal I eat vegetarian, but I couldn't eat meat. Once I got 4 boxes of food and everything was with meat (however I saw some vegetarian options at the display), so I gave it to a homeless man. Love it, but think it throughüòö",5,Google,2019-09-23

"This app is suspected to install fake updates may be even malware. I deinstalled it but this doesn't give a secure feeling because the undesired installation already took place. Google play is supposed to control updates, not the app. inviting me to install a new version. From a security perspective this is undesired and suspect behaviour.

"The app itself is a positive experience, it's neat, easy to navigate and simplistic. However.... after driving for over 30mins to the selected restaurant to be told there were no magic bags to be had was a bit of a let down. If there was a way the food establishments were able to confirm that they had availability, or the app sent notifications to the restaurant informing them of bag purchases in order to avoid wasted journeys I would use the app again",3,Google,2019-09-21
"I love this app, I've used it a few times now and it's worked well, saving a meal and saving me money. The app is straightforward to use, snd I like exploring with the Map feature.

"El app funciona bien, pero necesita a√±adir alguna opci√≥n para subir fotos de lo que se recibe y dejar opiniones de las empresas . He pedido en varios sitios y en ninguno he recibido lo que se supone es el precio de mercado. Lo peor es que en todas la tiendas ves como hay un mont√≥n de comida restante que, supongo, tirar√°n, por lo que la idea del app no se consigue y simplemente se ayuda a los comercios a hacer negocio de alguna manera. Tanto la app como el concepto detr√°s necesitan mejorar.",2,Google,2019-09-14

So easy. Walk in. Show your receipt on your phone. Then huge container comes out. Get your choice of meat and then fill up with veg. Such good value. My only complaint is I only have one place to go to within 10/15 minutes drive. Everywhere else is over half an hour away and more so is not a saving.,5,Google,2019-09-10

"Don't take your chances with this one. I have used the app twice and while its environmental concept is neat, some of the original prices can be misleading. You may be able to get a good amount of food for a small price, but on the flip end, only take away one small plastic box of food to choose from. And that latter option is apparently worth ¬£12 originally. I thought the concept was to save potentially wasted food, not make it a cheap way to get money from consumers!",3,Google,2019-09-06

Brilliant money saving app.,5,Google,2019-08-31
I love this app! I love seeing the comparison for how much energy or water was saved. Recent updates have made it more user-friendly too. My only complaint is that individual shop info is still in the local language even though the app is set to English and the rest of the app is English.,5,Google,2019-08-31

"Brilliant app for me, there are lots of places near my work that participate in this and I pass them regularly on my way home so always have an inexpensive and tasty evening meal when I dont fancy cooking myself.

"The app is fine, the concept is great, but it's useless at the moment if you don't live inner city. I'm not that far out of London but my closest places are 15-20km away in central. Looking forward to this kind of thing becoming more mainstream so there are more local options.",5,Google,2019-08-29

Excellent way,5,Google,2019-08-28
"Great idea and intervace however there is not much places outside of London that provide it, meaning you may have to do long drives just to get one of the boxes.

Easy to use and great value yummy food,5,Google,2019-08-27
"I'm overall very satisfied with the app, and use it relatively frequently. I feel what holds it back is the huge variations in portion sizes, which is something I wish was more transparent when you make an order. Additionally, I do wish it was more incentivized for business to write more personalized info about themselves, rather than what looks like a default text from 2g2g. Overall though, big fan, keep up the great work!",4,Google,2019-08-27

Absolutely wonderful,5,Google,2019-08-27
Awesome app and great for saving food from being chucked in the bin. And even if you only eat or like one thing out of it it's still great because it's cheaper than buying one thing from the menu and whatever you don't want to eat you could actually give the rest to a homeless person in need of food. 5 stars. Would give more if I could,5,Google,2019-08-27

I found it very easy to use the app and very easy to go and pick up my bag,5,Google,2019-08-26
Good value and good food. Definitely worth a try. Only one place involved in the scheme in my area but if other restaurants and caterers get on board it would be fantastic. Locality has a lot to do with it and the experience would be great in cities where more businesses are doing this. Hopefully this will take off. Anything that prevents perfectly good food from being wasted is a good thing.,5,Google,2019-08-26
So easy to use and food has been amazing.,5,Google,2019-08-26
The concept is really good. The contents of the magic bag are hit and miss. First one had bigger portions but the next one was so few and not worth picking up.,3,Google,2019-08-26
Forces you to share your details and log in before telling you it will be useless.,1,Google,2019-08-26
"Love this app, great way to try new things at great prices whilst stopping food waste. Carveries are the best as you can use the leftovers later- I use the veg to make bubble and squeak!

"Much better than I thought it would be to be honest. I think you need to have your expectations to be realistic though, you are getting the left overs that people don't want. The food is good and the price is amazing and the portion sizes are good. Choice is limited but as you need to remember, these are the bits of food that would have gone in the bin if it wasnt for the app. It is not prime picks, customers that pay the full regular price get those. This is the food bank of take out.",4,Google,2019-08-22

"Good app, less food wastage, hit and miss what or how much you're going to get but that is minimal in the context of food loss.

"Lots of food on offer from lunch rooms, bakeries, market stands and hotel breakfasts. Low prices, good quality food. Only downside is that some places seem less fanatical with regards to fighting waste, e.g. hotel breakfast putting mini-packs of jam in the magic box instead of only stuff that would otherwise be thrown away, like bread, ham and fruit.",5,Google,2019-08-21
"Really good so far, have to keep in mind it's all about using the waste that the companies will not be able to sell the day after you book it. Therefore it is luck of the draw as to what you get. So far very impressed.",5,Google,2019-08-21

I've had the occasional problem with outlets using the platform to sell food that isn't going to waste, in which case TGTG have refunded me within 24 hours.

Great idea but the interface is a little clunky.

This takes that chore out of my life and permits me still to have a varied diet of high quality grub at very reasonable prices.

"What's not to love here? Saving food from being wasted and you save money doing so.

"Great effort to avoid food going to waste. The experiences vary greatly from place to place, from business to business, from franchise to franchise, from location to location, from day to day ... Some are very, very good deals and some leave you thinking you just donated 5 euros. The app needs some minor ergonomic changes üòÅ",5,Google,2019-08-18

Having worked in many kitchens this will never take off. Most chefs would happily bin it than spend even another minute on it. What would be better if YOU took the food and preserved it/made something in bulk.,1,Google,2019-08-17
"The app is brilliant! I am happy to use it knowing that paet of the food is not thrown away! However, the location is not precise. Although I use the location of the telephone, the nearby stores and restaurants offered are far from my place. There is no option to enter an address or a postcode.",3,Google,2019-08-17

"There are literally 2 or 3 stores that use this app in the whole of Norfolk and Suffolk, its fine for urban areas I. e it's fine for London, but what's the point if you have to drive 20-30 miles to pick this stuff up. Need to promote more in rural and non urban areas and weirdly we do actually have restaurants, super markets and other food dispenseries, we don't just hunt for our food, there is plenty of opportunity out in and rural areas for this app, but sadly its over looked yet again shame!",1,Google,2019-08-16
"brilliant app, super easy to use and amazing deals",5,Google,2019-08-16
"I use two food waste apps, this app often provides more, but poor training and implementation in the shops at collection time does leave a lot to be desired. On going into a shop where cell signal is poor to be told that unless the redemption is swiped there and then the food will not be handed over is weird. Other apps allow for this to be handled in the shops. And what's this thing where they feel they must swipe the app themselves? No one should be requesting to touch my phone!",3,Google,2019-08-16

"Although this is a brilliant premise, we used this for the first time today and have basically lost ¬£5.98 down the metaphorical drain. We ordered two bags from a local cafe but the owner wasnt in- it is almost impossible to contact TGTG for a refund, so we've had to go through the caf√© themselves.

"The app itself is great and unproblematic. Individual responses from different food outlets vary from 2 to 5 star experiences though. I've had to ask for more food to make sure that what I received was worth the ¬£10 full price quoted in the app, rather than the ¬£3 to ¬£5 that I actually paid; this was embarrassing, unnecessary and unfair. I am not begging at a food bank, I am a customer who has chosen to buy discounted food at the end of the day, so should be treated as such, rather than 2nd best",4,Google,2019-08-14

Dont use this app. It's a marketing tool for food companies. They gave me a specificed amount of food that wasn't being thrown away. It was basically just ordering from their menu. This is specifically for a natural food store on bold Street in Liverpool. I've heard that from hotel buffets and places it can be good but be careful where you choose!!,1,Google,2019-08-14

"Brilliant idea! More companies need to do their [honest] part like the Accor group. Some retailers take the piss hence the 3 stars as there should be more control or checks, not the devs fault, but they should have some sort of bustergram...

"I am keen to help reduce food waste but have now had two poor experiences with the app. Both vendors had enticing descriptions of what you might take home but what was received bore little resemblance to the highly misleading descriptions in the app. I never saw a ""magic bag"" of delightful surprises and left feeling a bit ripped off and disillusioned. It felt more like a way for the shops to take advantage of the eco conscious than genuinely using food that would otherwise have been wasted.",2,Google,2019-08-09

It is a really good idea but... in Germany there are supermarkets where people can go and pick up all food and products they can carry for FREE.

"Brilliant concept to fight food waste and get good food for a good price. Besides, it also permits discovering new tastes.

Awesome app.,5,Google,2019-08-04
"While the concept and underlying intention are great my experience is that many places misuse it to sell cheap ingredients at a comparably high price. Several times I saw lots of leftovers when coming to a restaurant just before closing-time and was told that I could only get beans and rice while other (more expensive) toppings such as meat, cheese or exotic fruit were ""not intended for too good to go"". I wonder what they do with the more expensive stuff (my guess is that it goes to the trash).",3,Google,2019-08-04
The app is so easy to use and who doesn't love discounted food,5,Google,2019-08-04
This app is pretty good and I definitely support the idea of reducing food waste. I've only used this app for one transaction so far and it has been easy enough & successful. Will keep testing with other local shops. However it would be ideal to be able to see reviews of other people and their interactions /experiences with certain places. Now that would be very helpful.,4,Google,2019-08-04
"Great idea but it needs to be a bit more dynamic. Few options for vegetarian and info is vague as to what kind of food is actually on offer. Would be nice if you had choices of 'Veggie Box', 'Gluten free box', etc. even if most places only offer 1 box type, at least you know what it is. It seems like stores use it to sell more instead of actually getting rid of excess. Offers are released the day before rather than at the end of the day as you'd expect. Reviews of stores would also useful.",3,Google,2019-08-04
"the reason am giving it atleast 3 stars is i believe in the concept and i heard others managed to have it work but i sadly haven't, i paid and i arrived at the site (spar) on time to get my first magic box and heard that theu didnt have any left, so i got sent home empty handed, now there is little way to contact too good to go vai the telefoon, so i wrote a email. this was 3 days ago and i wonder if they will pay me back my money or solve it in ontother way",3,Google,2019-08-04

What these people do is astonishing. Food wastage is a big problem and this company solves a big portion of that. Also makes even fancy places silly affordable if you ever wanted to explore them but were on a budget. I mean.. it's only good. There's literally nothing I could complain about. Easiest 5 stars I have given.,5,Google,2019-07-22

"The idea is fantastic. Sadly I think a large number of retailers have little interest in saving waste and have seen an opportunity to make money with little recourse - as who's going to complain about ¬£3 or ¬£4 here or there. There are some I'm sure that are genuinely trying to combat food waste, and don't just see it as a profit boosting exercise, but I think they are in their minority.",1,Google,2019-07-22

Excellent idea!,5,Google,2019-07-22
"Saving the planet is not cheap and full of fluffy rhetoric with this app. You have to give personal details to have a look, so use a temporary email address for this. This is a greedy for profit business, don't be tricked by the saving the planet garbage. All the food is bundled together so you better be a human dustbin or else you'll be the one throwing away food. I'm actually annoyed at these people.",1,Google,2019-07-22
"A good initiative but just not good value. Don't expect the participating outlets to be as enthusiastic about this as the app makes it sound. Be prepared for megre portions, average food quality and to be treated like a second class customer. The original cost of the meals is also misleading. I wouldn't recommend this.",2,Google,2019-07-22
Poor execution. See the Google reviews which reflect the problems of this service a lot better.,1,Google,2019-07-22

"Just picked up my first bag from a local bakery, and it was, quite simply, fantastic. Got a good amount of food for the price, and tasted excellent. All whilst saving waste! The only 'criticism' I have is that there are very little (if any) establishments signed up in rural areas. But with a new scheme, it'll always take time to take-off. That paired with it not necessarily being TGTG's fault means no stars lost. Would recommend!",5,Google,2019-07-21
bit hit and miss but even when it's a miss you're still paying way under the odds. When you get a good one it's a great deal and some amazing food for cheap,5,Google,2019-07-21
"This was the first time I used the service. I got a loaf of bread plus some patries and a salad. It was a fun experience and it wasn't my intention to ""get a deal"" as I am not really near any participating outlets. However, it was definitely a deal and I gave it all to a homeless couple I met on my way back to the car. That made it a great experience and I will do it again.",5,Google,2019-07-21

Requiring to register before being able to see anything the app does is a big no go for me. This is the reason why I installed it and immediately uninstalled it. I understand that you need to register to order food but not when you just want to take a look at what the app does. Maybe you could add a skip registration button to the start screen and require the registration once an order is placed.,1,Google,2019-07-21

"Foodwaste is a big discussion topic nowadays and TGTG offers a way to reduce it through an app. It's a win-win situation as the shops can plan in a couple portions more, which will make the buffet/shelf look still decent at the end of the day for their clients, which in turn will help all the food be sold. In a future version I would really want to see my favorites primary sorted by available/sold out and a push notification so that shops can push new items throughout the day.",5,Google,2019-07-20
"I used this app plenty of times and 1/4 of the time there is no food left. They should have something to warn us instead of having you waste your time coming there , waiting for reason and being told "" Sorry no food left"".

Ik vind dit een fantastisch initiatief, de app werkt goed en is simpel in gebruik.

"The app is great, easy to use, shows the nearby options and facilitates the payment. But the quantity of the food varies quite significantly vendor to vendor and there isn't any ratings so you have to just give it a shot. As a suggestion I think it would be better to encourage use of reusable tubs, some vendors give you (non optional) loads of packaging which ain't very eco friendly.",4,Google,2019-07-18

"Edit after TGTG response - the reason I gave a bad review is not to get some freebies. The reason is the unacceptable flaw in your process, which allows having to go to the place for nothing. Can you not reject the order 15 mins before collection? To at least save the hassle of getting there? And save waiters from having to deal with an angry customer? Mind you, my order was for 2 bags, so the estimation is way way off. Saving the planet by increasing unnecessary travel? Way to go.",1,Google,2019-07-15

"I have used this a handful of times and would recommend it. BUT - It doesn't work as marketed. WHAT I THOUGHT HAPPENS: You arrive at the END OF THE DAY to pick up leftovers and leave with a BAG of unwanted and unused food items. What ACTUALLY happens: You arrive and pick up the equivalent of a meal, which is usually in a medium sized takeaway container. Essentially You are just paying for one meal at a reduced price.

There's no filter for allergens/preferences and it is actually quite expensive ($5-$10 for a meal). So instead of potentially getting a basket with gluten/dairy/soy that I will throw away (and I'm assuming many of these leftovers are sandwiches with all of the above) I can make my own meal for this much money or buy something guaranteed to be appropriate for my needs,2,Google,2019-07-06

bonne initiative mais en gros c'est ou il jette ou tu paye pas ch√®re mais tu paye quand m√™me. je pensais pouvoir me servir de cette application pour organiser des repas caritatif. Pas encore gratuit de r√©cup√©rer de la nourriture destin√©e √† la poubelle. dommage.,3,Google,2019-07-01

very easy to use and collected food with no fuss at all,4,Google,2019-06-30

great idea and great app,5,Google,2019-06-30
"After reading all the negative reviews I was a bit skeptical about using the app. I noticed there was a Green King Pub less then a 10 minute walk from me offering the deal, so I bit the bullet and tried . I will admit the staff had little knowledge of the app and a more informed manager was needed but I will now be having a full Sunday roast for lunch tomorrow with all the trimmings. I imagine the larger chains are more willing to part with their wasted food then the smaller restaurants.",5,Google,2019-06-30
Fab service if only used once. hope to do this regularly to be honest. great choice of options available and all good for food waste. what's not to love.,5,Google,2019-06-30
Works great,5,Google,2019-06-30
"I like the idea of fighting food waste. Plus the bonus is you can save money? Well, based on my recent experience, not really. So the issue I have with the app is that it doesn't have the option for feedback/rating on the purchase. If I am not happy with the purchase I should be able to say something about it. It's not like the food is free. And nobody likes to waste money. So I think the ""you don't know what you will get"" might be misused opportunistically by the seller.",1,Google,2019-06-30

great app easy to use (although poor selection of locations in Devon) today on a visit to Reading used it to get an amazing magic box from Wolf Italian street food which was amazing only ¬£2.99 for the most amazing food which would only of gone to waste. well done we will beat the war on waste!!,5,Google,2019-06-30

Paid for a magic bag from Sarras Leeds and really enjoyed trying foods that I'd never think to order myself! Excellent way of trying new foods and places to eat. Will definitely be ordering again,5,Google,2019-06-29
"Quite good, both app and - in general - the offers.",4,Google,2019-06-29
I used to really like this app and I still love the concept. Unfortunately in my more recent experience the businesses I have been to haven't entered into the spirit to which this concept is intended. I don't feel I am stopping food going to waste as the magic boxes have all been pre-prepared with a small number of items which I don't think is helping to stop food waste when I see just how much excess food is still likely to go to waste. Regretfully uninstalling,2,Google,2019-06-29
Easy and good value!,5,Google,2019-06-29
Fantastic idea and so much better than going to landfill. I paid ¬£3.79 for a magic bag from B&B coffee and got 6 assorted muffins and 2 cheese scones. All very fresh and tasty and would have paid much more walking in and ordering as normal.,5,Google,2019-06-29
"Have used the app 4 times now and have always had fresh food at around half price, but it could do with an option for people with dietary restrictions, for example I just got a magic bag from love koffee and we could only eat 2 of the 4 items as the others had pork which we don't eat, so I probably paid the equivalent of full price for what we ate.",3,Google,2019-06-29

too good go more like to good to miss what a life saver however you need to be willing to travel as some neighbourhoods dont have much variety or few outlets have signed up to the service. Its a lucky dip so if your a fussy eater and on a budget or have little time best not risk it but if you like to gamble and try new places you would normally miss this is the place. look forward to more places being added nationwide,5,Google,2019-06-28

Amazing. I always get good food (that will otherwise get wasted) for dinner or for the following day at work while saving money. Simply an amazing service :),5,Google,2019-06-27
"The app runs really well, but I've been to 4 seperate places across different days and times, and I've been unimpressed with what I've got, I understand it's a mystery and it's all about reducing waste but 3/4 places were a waste of time, i don't think i even got the value I paid. I think the app needs a way to rate the place, I'm all for helping the planet, but it's been a total waste of money so far. some places should donate to homeless shelters and not try and make money from bad offers",2,Google,2019-06-27
great app in the Brussels area,5,Google,2019-06-27
"So easy to use, I browsed through, found something I fancied and made payment through PayPal. At the store I showed my receipt on my phone an got my magic bag. Easy as that!",5,Google,2019-06-27
"Unfair, the shop(dunkn donats) can cancel the reservation in the last moment, which made me quite angry because i planed the pickup. So I ordered again the time frame was 30 minutes from 20:30 to 21h, something really important got into my schedule so i wasnt able to pick it up and wasnt able to cancel it. Its just unfair, and from my other experience a bad deal(cupcakes, you get the items that nobody wants for half of the price). Its scam until you add rating and comments! customer last !",1,Google,2019-06-27
"really good app. plenty of food and drink to rescue in my local area. very pleased with everything I have tried so far. most of the places I have never been to before this app as I can't afford full price but for what you pay on this app it's as cheap as a McDonald's for posh food, love it.",5,Google,2019-06-27

seamless! tried it for the first time today and came home with a bag of goodies. next time I'm gna give it to the homeless. will be even better if there was a selection of places nearer to my work or home as the times to collect do not fit in with work etc but that cant be helped as these times are outside of the usual meal times,5,Google,2019-06-26

great idea. working for a restaurants over the years always havig to throw away food is sacrilege. and company thinks if staff take it away then whoever does the books can say ohh theres more faking forms so they have a free dinner. this is a great idea away from that. still make money off stuff they dont sell. genius,5,Google,2019-06-22
I decided to give a try and guys true nice concept but is not working at the moment to redeem my order and I still had 10 min left once I arrived at the place because they where closing they just told me there is anything and we are closing I just hope to be refunded because is not correct give avay money like that Don't download it,1,Google,2019-06-22

its a good idea but pls make it so you get free food also like if greegs did not sell any sausage rolls they should give them on the app cold sausage rolls for free even if it's cold they should give it for free at least you still get food haven't tried it. yet it looks good.,4,Google,2019-06-20

options are pretty limited but the idea is great,3,Google,2019-06-18
I think this app is a great idea but I think they should come up with a way to state dietry requirements before you buy stuff through the app because otherwise you might be ordering food that you can't eat and it will end up getting wasted anyway. If you have dietry options the stores could make these bags of food up with that in mind. It would make it much more convenient and streamline the process. Because of my dietry requirements I am probably not going to use this app as much as I could.,1,Google,2019-06-18

"App und Idee sind super, aber Umsetzung l√§sst zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig: leider kommt es in letzter Zeit geh√§uft vor, das wir zu Beginn der Abholzeit als erste TooGoodToGoler im Laden stehen (hier sind ausschlie√ülich Einzelh√§ndler und B√§ckereien im Umfeld die teilnehmen, keine Restaurants) und wieder weggeschickt werden, weil das Angebot bereits ausverkauft ist. Da TooGoodToGo nichts zur√ºckerstattet (bereits mehrfach angefragt) einigen wir uns mit den Verk√§ufern zumeist auf eine Abholung am n√§chsten Werktag.  Dies funktioniert aber nur dann wenn der passende Mitarbeiter dann auch Dienst hat, sonder verz√∂gert es sich um weitere Tage. Die Abholzeiten liegen auch selten so, dass wir nach der Arbeit hinfahren k√∂nnten, Abholungen bedeuten f√ºr uns fast immer extra Fahrerei, wir k√∂nnen und wollen schlie√ülich nicht jeden Tag einen Wocheneinkauf machen. Auch passiert es leider h√§ufig, dass an den Ausweichabholtagen die wir m√ºndlich verabredet haben, das Angebot schon leer ist. Diese zus√§tzliche Fahrerei ist f√ºr die Umwelt warscheinlich schlimmer als ein Br√∂tchen, dass am n√§chsten Tag einfach zum halben PReis verkauft wird‚Ä¶ Vielleicht funktioniert das ganze im Ballungsraum und f√ºr Restaurants besser",2,Google,2019-06-15
"The idea relies on sharing the access food which would be wasted otherwise. In Paris, it seems to be working better than it does in London. Profitability, for both App and Restaurant owners, is still the main concern here. ¬£3.56 for rock solid bread selection is not right. Waitrose/M&S give similar products away for pennies.

Can I be reimbursed? Can I report them? I can come back there later but I won't be able to give a proper feedback on this shop in the app because my receipt is not longer valid.

Start using this app - NOW!,5,Google,2019-06-06
You have to be really funny. I complain about your customer service and you send me the same link that takes them almost a week to answer to two simple questions excusing that it was sent to UK?.. I didn't know a form takes a week to arrive. Start by improving that and the possibility to actually advance that you're going to get veggies and not meat or don't offer the filter on the map at all. The only thing it does is desinform people. You can keep that link to yourselves now.,1,Google,2019-06-06
"Great idea behind but the support is really terrible. They take 3 days to answer an email and there is no information to be found anywhere in the Web. They allow you to filter for ""veggie"" meals but then you get a big box of meat. Terrible experience",1,Google,2019-06-06

"Such a great idea but unfortunately there is no way to specify vegan only food. They do have a veggie only section though so perhaps it is just a matter of time before they add a vegan section too. I also noticed there is no way of listing your allergies in say your profile or anything to make it a bit more accessible to people who may be allergic to various things. A shame, as overall this is a fantastic idea that I would really support if I could.",3,Google,2019-05-22

"1st few gies were excellent - good food (mixture) at decent price but the last 3 have been v poor indeed - maybe a coincidence that 1st ones are good - food outlets gibing out scraps i wouldnt feed to the local rats - 3 boxes of lettuce is what ive gotten last 3 purvhases - a con, be very careful",1,Google,2019-05-22
"Good idea but has few problems. The buyer can't choose which is fine. But they also can't control what they get. I have placed 4 orders so far. Three of them were very good. Fourth order was absolute rubbish. I ordered from a coffee shop (Wired cafe) expecting contents to be of bakery and sweet nature. What I recieved was box of rotten salad with lots of peppers and lettuce, out of date sandwich that didn't have good smell. Contacted the customer service through app twice - no response!",1,Google,2019-05-22
"I used it for the Novotel breakfast. Food was minimal and pretty bad - certainly none of the sausages or 'lovely fresh flaky pastries' that were described. Apparently worth ¬£13! I would say it was just barely worth the ¬£2.50 I paid for it, and as I had to collect it, not worth the time and petrol. There's also no way in the app to submit individual restaurant reviews so you can't share experiences. I'm all for reducing food waste but I think some of your restaurant patrons are missing the point.",2,Google,2019-05-22

Both times i got ridiculously small ""magic bags"" and wish a receipt at least proved I was getting discounted items.",2,Google,2019-05-03
I live on Anglesey and the closest places to purchase is either Llandudno (which only ever has one place) or Liverpool. Not worth it for my area :(,1,Google,2019-05-03
really cool idea and app is smooth to use,5,Google,2019-05-03
"cette application est une pure merveille et le principe d'aller chercher de la nourriture pour pas qu'elle soit perdue est absolument formidable. quelques bugs au niveau du paiement paypal souvent dus au navigateur, je conseille Firefox plut√¥t que opera Mini ou Chrome pour le paiement par Paypal. Et commer√ßants sont tr√®s gentils, et cela me permet de peu √† peu me faire conna√Ætre et et appr√©cier des enseignes qui sont partenaires. j'ai aussi la joie d'√™tre ambassadeur et de faire conna√Ætre l'appli",4,Google,2019-05-02

Excellent idea for an app. Eliminating food waste and the businessess involved make some otherwise lost earnings. My experiences with the retailers has been all positive. Only down side may prove to be my waistline.,5,Google,2019-05-02
"only used a few times but excellent food every time. Most cafes and resteraunt have themes such as Chinese, sushi, sandwiches etc so although actual dish is a surprise you kind of know what you are getting. Might not suit everyone but love the surprise element. They don't tell you the amount of carbon emissions you are saving anymore they used to and that was good but still making a small difference which is good and cheaper food so is all good",4,Google,2019-05-02

"It's hit and miss. Picked up a box before and it contained about two tablespoons worth of tomato lentil salad and soggy piece of quiche in the same box. Other times gone to pick up and told nothing left or only one item left. Surely, they should honour any orders placed but there is no cancel button. Also, can't leave reviews to forewarn people of bad experience. Anti food waste so will continue to support but will try other apps.",3,Google,2019-05-01

I've had some great leftover food from the places around my area! luckily i live in a bigger city so there's quite a selection to choose from at various times of the day. this app will only improve with more companies hopping on the train,5,Google,2019-04-29

I would strongly recommend this app to everyone who cares about the environment and likes great quality food at low prices xx,5,Google,2019-04-25
"Was really cautious as it seemed too good to be true but the food was amazing ,the portion was enough for a generous meal for one and the whole process was simple .",5,Google,2019-04-25
"For just under 4 quid I ended up with enough food for two hearty meals. So I consider that a win. The app should explain the swiping of the receipt button though, as I think the vendor is meant to do that bit when you go to pick up , but I had swiped it before my pick up time. I wasn't sure if I had to swipe it to confirm my purchase before picking up my food.",5,Google,2019-04-25
"Straightforward to use the app, and good range of food places. Of course, paying for a meal at a fraction of the cost makes it taste better. Well done guys!",5,Google,2019-04-25
"The participating restaurants were very accommodating. As soon as I mentioned magic bag, they were aware of the app and its waste reducing ways. The price paid on the app is definitely reasonable for the value and amount of food provided.",5,Google,2019-04-25
Great bargains. Easy to use the app. My first order was from a place i always wanted to try. I picked up a pack of crispy salmon sushi (8 in the pack) for ¬£2.99. The normal price is ¬£4.50. I also saw that I can get some food from some of my favourite places.,5,Google,2019-04-24

Amazing,5,Google,2019-04-24
"this app is great for getting some ""nice deals"" and getting leftovers from partaking companies. also it's great companies can cancel if they notice they won't have leftovers. for anyone with dietary restrictions its not as ideal as you (and the store too) don't know what kind of products you can get but that's understandable even though inconvenient. I've regularly used this app for the last 6 months and I'll continue using it!",5,Google,2019-04-24

"Click on ""ingredients and allergens"" and it just tells you to phone the shop. Not massively helpful. I don't really want to be negotiating with individual cafes/restaurants. I'm vegetarian and I do not want to be phoning 10 places to see if they might have the possibility of a vegetarian box. I mean, I could do that without the app. Is there no way you could get your participants to offer at least, say, a vegan option, or to say sorry, we can't do that?",3,Google,2019-04-22

This is wonderful!,5,Google,2019-04-22
"I love the concept! But, sadly, I can't use the app at all - for one reason. I think surprise bags are reqlly good - but there should be an option to see what can and what can't be in there. For example - I am vegan, so I don't want any meat, fish, milk, eggs etc in my bags. The same for allergies - what if someone with a nut allergy gets something with peanuts? That could be really dangerous. So I think something like that should be integrated. Sorry if it is already and I didn't see.",3,Google,2019-04-22
fabulous concept and if you live in a city brilliant. But if you have specific dietary requirements it is not much use. wish it could be extended to farmers or growers and save even more waste,5,Google,2019-04-22

"I think it's wonderful to see more and more stores get on the same bandwagon and try to help minimize food waste. It's not something they do to make a profit, but solely to make sure that food doesn't get thrown into the bin.

"I hope that more and more shops and cafes will join this app! So far it has been great. Be prepared it can be quite different every time (visiting the same place), sometimes it is a bit more than other times. But, you still save a lot, and you fight food waste!

A very nice application that not only allows you to be more mindful on food wastes but at the same time to allow you to try out some restaurants in the area.

"About 50% of the time you get food thats worth the money. You can sometimes turn up and get nothing or just a single pastry when you've paid ¬£3.50. I get that you are just getting whats left over but I don't think its fair that you can pay amd then lose out in this way.

"The app and the concept are linked. The App works well, the concept is good, execution bad. The mystery bags can be too varied. Many places offer savoury and sweet together in the listing and it can be annoying when you detour home hoping for baked goods and get savoury or vice versa. Some places offer different values and different listings for this 'hot' 'cold' 'sweet' until many others do the same I'm going to stop using it.",1,Google,2019-03-14

"You need to be able to review the sellers of the items and there should be much more transparency!   Yes it is meant to be leftovers but they should still be enjoyable to eat and at a low price.   Transparency is also needed on what your bag might actually contain and the age of the food being given to you.  i.e. I used a bakery who provided cupcakes over a day old which were stale. Knowing that they were providing 1+ day old food I would not have bought from them. For the price I paid it was extremely disappointing for the quality of food.  A great concept but a risky way to get a meal as it seems 50/50 whether you'll get some edible, value for money and not profit making.",3,Google,2019-03-12

"Sounds good on paper but the lack of respect and seriousness from the restaurant makes this a terrible experience. They need to respect too good to go costumers as much as a normal customer. Unfortunately thats not the case. Using this app you are going to experience some nonsense stuff like: 1. if you are early or late 5 minutes they don't serve you and there is no refund. FIVE MINUTES. 2. portions are too small for the money you pay. Eg full meal 5, waste food 4 pounds and 30% of the portion",1,Google,2019-02-16

"absolutely awesome in london, where there's loads of places offering stuff at all times. You need to not be picky as it can sometimes be hit or miss, so just make sure you're happy to pay that price and take whatever you're given. I've had huge trays of sushi for ¬£3.50, but i've also had snotty managers who are reluctant to let you go with a single cake.

Great app for those who are looking to try something new for cheap or just wanting to reduce waste.

"The app works great, technically. It's impressive they got so many restaurants to work with them. Quality of the food, especially the amount, varies (in Utrecht). I feel like most shops give you about what you would've paid for the stuff if you bought it fresh, nothing like the 3x value they advertise. Worst offender was a baker that gave me 2 stale pieces of bread for ‚Ç¨5, and the same evening I saw trashbags filled with bread in front of the store that same evening. ü§îü§îü§î",3,Google,2019-01-12

"I like most of the app functionality and have enjoyed many great deals through TGTG. couple of downsides: 1. you can't search for a location. Instead, only the nearest geolocated places are shown. looking for somewhere else requires panning on the map atm. 2. many places end up being a gamble, as a vegetarian. I've been lucky so far that there's always been vegetarian options when getting food . But it's not guaranteed a lot of the time.",4,Google,2018-12-28

"Mostly this is places giving you a late night food deal a little bit cheaper. I've had 2 great meals, both from the end of an all you can eat place, and several disappointing ones where you'd be better off choosing your own dosh as the place is still serving.

"Too good to go is really useful. It can show all shops that offer food that would have been wasted around the area you are. App works always fine and shows you very quickly the options and it is easy to buy. For ¬£3,50 I was given bakery products that I estimated they would cost me ¬£23 otherwise. The staff was very happy as well that people use it because otherwise they would be obliged to throw the food so I had a very useful chat with them.",5,Google,2018-12-19
Not sure if I'm rating the app or the the company. That kind of doubt removes a star. the removal of the second star is because it all would be great if there was an option to save a pick up directly to a calendar. that would definitely help reduce the possibility of forgetting a pick up on busy days.,3,Google,2018-12-18

"Excellent concept, no-thrills & easy to use. It's a great way to not only help reduce food waste, but also explore your city and its culinary offer. And offer depends heavily on one's location obviously (I can imagine there's more going on in the UK or Copenhagen). For Berlin it's unfortunately mostly caf√©s (B√§ckerei) who charge too much for what they sell - low quality baked goods (that they're gonna throw away anyhow) available to pick up at very late hours. There are of course exceptions - cute, little places I wouldn't have found myself otherwise.Would love to see more restaurants and supermarkets onboard!

"Great idea let down by misleading pricing, your milage will vary massively. Rare places you can get a great deal. Mostly though you are just paying close to full price for leftovers. Especially annoying is the crossed out price that suggests what you would be paying which generally turns out to be a complete lie. For example original price ¬£6.99 knocked down to ¬£3.49 and I end up getting 3 pain au chocolate. ¬£2.33 for a stale pastry... Don't think so.",2,Google,2018-12-02

Well im seriously pi#@ed off with this app its a complete rip off the food we got was supposed to cost ¬£12 but paid ¬£6 went all the way there on my peddle bike when i got there the woman didn't have a clue why i was there even when i showed her the order on my phone she was still baffled so i waited for 10 minutes and she brought a bag over containing 2 asda price muffins ( that cost ¬£1 for 6) 1 pack of quavers 1 ham sandwich with 1 slice of cheap ham 1 sandwich with a tiny bit of cheese if i was to pay the original price of ¬£12 i would be absolutely raging ..so i will be uninstalling the app after ive finished writing this and will also be copy and pasting this review onto any website i can find SO THANKS FOR RIPPING ME OFF NICE ONE,1,Google,2018-11-23

"The concept is great, so tried to get some food after leaving work really late (and seriously hungry). I booked the last 2 portions from Banh Bao Brothers - Waterloo - London and in the 5min or less it took me to get there somehow they either sold them to someone else or threw it away, not sure. They said the kitchen was closed and ""they can't communicate with the app"" and ""I can just ask for a refund"". Not impressed, also because if one misses their booked meals will likely find no restaurants open so late (and this is much worse if people are using this app because they're short on cash)",2,Google,2018-11-20

"Great idea, Ponzi scheme execution. The app has accepted my purchase twice when a store was closed. When I contact the customer support by email I got an automatic response saying that the email address is incorrect. It's not as much about my eight bucks as it is about the principal to sell me something that is impossible to pick up.

"The users should be able to see pictures or at least names of left dishes, so that they can decide whether they will order or not without the need for calling the restaurant. Also I can't understand why some restaurants write old crossed price below the current one, while others don't. It would also be a plus if there's a filter on restaurants using categories instead of scrolling for long time or hitting search multiple times.",4,Google,2018-11-16

Nowhere on the app does it tell you that your order can be cancelled by the store because there is a possibility they might not have leftovers for the day.

"The app & idea are great. However, the shops/restaurants that advertise through it can be complete frauds.

make money. Here our experience: We ordered a couple of minutes after 
midnight. The allotted time-frame was from mid-day until eight in the 
evening (the shop closes at this time). I already found it curious that you 
were able to pick up the box during regular business hours; why can't they 
sell the TGTG-products during the day? Upon arrival at six, the box was 
handed to us by the kind lady. I think she saw our disappointment because 
she rushed away. The box contained two cabbages, a few carrots, some really 
old and smelly mint which was definitely good to go, and a handful of dried 
fruit. Definitely not worth the money. And in all honesty it looks a lot 
like the shop uses the app to sell stuff they wouldn't sell otherwise for 
full money. Shame!",1,Google,2018-08-10

"The concept and design of the app is great, very easy to use. It's a little 
scary at first if you've never used it - I wasn't exactly sure what to do. 
After trying it though, it was very simple. Just pick a place that has some 
portions left, order however many you want, then pay. Once I got there at 
the allocated time, I showed the people behind the counter the app and then 
they just told me what I could pick from and I did. Only used it once, I 
don't know if some places just give you something or if they all let you 
pick, but that was my experience. Obviously you don't know what you'll get 
until you arrive, which can be an issue if you're vegetarian etc, but it's 
a risk you have to take I guess (worked out for me). Also, would be good to 
rate places, hopefully this will be added soon. All in all, good first 
experience.",5,Google,2018-08-03

"App werkt goed en in Groningen zitten er zo te zien ook al meerdere  winkels/restaurantjes bij aangesloten. Leuk initiatief!  Edit:  Leuk initiatief maar in de praktijk zitten er wat haken en ogen aan. Het is zoals in andere reviews genoemd sterk afwachten wat je krijgt en of de waarde ervan ook echt maakt dat het de moeite waard is. Daarnaast, wat ik zelf net heb meegemaakt, als je net een paar minuten te laat aankomt (in mijn geval door verkeersdrukte) je de magic box volledig misloopt en het aankoopbedrag ook niet terug krijgt. Ik had het vast wel een dag later nog op kunnen komen halen maar dat is dus niet mogelijk.   Je betaalt dus eigenlijk niet voor een magic box maar je betaalt voor de mogelijkheid om binnen een kort tijdsbestek (in dit geval was dat 30 minuten) een magic box te komen ophalen waarbij het afwachten is of wat er in zit wel het geld waard is.   Reviewscore op basis van nieuwe ervaring bijgesteld, ik zal hier geen gebruik meer van maken.

food to the waste bin. I asked if I could buy couple of more bags so that 
she wouldn't throw the bread, sandwiches and other goods.. She answered 
that she wasn't allowed to sell it. In my opinion, she was just lazy to 
prepare couple of more bags and let it for sale. After arguing with her 
about that, I decided that it was my last purchase there. Shame on you,

did my first buy a couple of days ago but ended up having things in my 
package that I didn't like at al, neither did my flatmates so we had to 
throw it out again. If you'd be given the option to either see what you are

I'm only a new user, but this already saved me money and I feel better knowing that the food I bought will get eaten instead of being thrown in the trash. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark and there are plenty of venues which work with this app around me  - from bakeries and sushi places to flower shops trying to get rid of cut flowers at the end of the day.

"It was a good idea to have this app because instead of wasting the left foods, then the restaurant sell it for the good price.

And save the foods for the waste.",5,Google,2018-03-10

An amazing initiative! Me and my husband use the app regularly and we love it :),5,Google,2018-03-06
"I used this app for the first time today, used it twice. I really like that you can filter out the stores whose offers are sold out, and also alter the time so you can easily find something while you are out.  Of course the selection will vary depending on how much the reataurant has sold for the day aswell as how many people have bought the offer. For me that is part if the fun. Sometimes you get much enough you can also share it with hungry people on the street.  One suggestion for improvement: As it is now, if I search according to postal code, it only shows if a shop is available at that exact postal code. It would be great if you could type in postal code or street name and get results nearby that particular place for when you plan to travel.",5,Google,2018-03-05

"I love the concept, but too bad most of the stores around here is always 100% of the time always marked as 'closed for today'. There needs to be a cleanup of stores that's never open.. They reached out to me asking me which stores that's always marked as close for the day, where i gave them a list (something i feel is their job to keep track of and not the customer). I got a mail saying they forward it. Days passed and i get an e-mail saying it was solved... Nothing was done! I checked the app, the stores were still there and still closed. They didn't say what was solved. I'm sure they just wanted the case out of their system. Bad customer service.",2,Google,2018-03-05
"I love this app, but since the last update, the map hasn't been working well, and it only shows very fewer places than the ones which are available on the list",4,Google,2018-03-04

"I would like it really because the idea is not bad, but a feature to auto translate to English would be great. I cannot read the text and to copy paste from one app to another is demotivating. Especially when I'm hungry...    LATER EDIT: Yeah, now i see that the mention i did was inaccurate. The UI elements are indeed shown in English. I am living in Germany, but not able to speak it. The issue i had...was with the content put by restaurant itself...when they put that...""we offer pizza with bla and bla""...that would be a blast if you guys could offer ahead of time transation and show a collapsed tag that can be expanded with the translation itself. That would help me..based on the picture and the translation to make a correct choice. Thanks. Hope it helps, if not bounce back  LATER EDIT[2]: All good. If it's in the backlog its good. No rush...anyway the app has not a lot of traction yet in Leipzig (DE)...10 places in total. Maybe in 1 year will catch more traction and will install it again. Cheers",2,Google,2018-01-08

Too good to go is a nice app. It has a great purpose. But I do think it's good to have customer reviews about the hotel. We are not sure what you have bargained for or prices are. But some hotels are really rude. Some restaurants won't care these sort of customers. I guess you need to give an option to rate the hotels and content on the quality of food üòÄ,4,Google,2017-12-05

"I love the idea of cutting food waste and getting some nice food for a reduced price. I have mostly good experiences with this app, some places really hand over a good amount of food. There are 2 things the developers should consider changing to improve the app in my opinion:  1. After having had a problem twice with ""sorry we've nothing left for TGTG orders"" there needs to be an easy refund option directly in the app. The seller should confirm how many of the selected portions were picked up for an automatic refund if not all portions were supplied.  2. For future updates I would like to see the seller being able to update if less portions are available. If they sell out to ""regular customers"", a (push) notification that my TGTG order is not or only partially available would be fantastic. Again with an automatic refund.  Keep up the good work! and keep pushing to sign up new participants.",4,Google,2017-11-21
"I have been using this in Manchester and so far have been disappointed. Of the places I have tried, I have received a big piece of stale plain sponge cake (clearly just an ingredient) from a fancy cake shop that was not worth the ¬£3 price tag and a wrap with a tiny piece of sausage and a ton of kale that promised lots of meat and Ruben sandwiches. I have found that most restaurants are obviously using this to turn a profit while providing you with low quality goods. You are also looked down upon often when using the app and even when coming within the allotted time window restaurants often are unprepared and glower at you while preparing some underwhelming item. This app really needs a review function. There is also no way to report restaurants that are honestly ripping you off. This needs to be sorted out.",2,Google,2017-11-20
"I just used this. Restaurant gave me the tiniest portion of food and essentially ripped me off. However the too good team were great, i contacted them on fb where they redirected me to an email address within an hour and less than 24 hours after complaining my money has been refunded which I'll have in a few days. They did say they are looking to have users ratings of restaurents visible to other users which hopefully will help weed out the more unscrupulous places. Defo going to try again as idea is great and everyone deserves a second chance!",4,Google,2017-11-16
The problem is that you must first buy and pay and then you will go to check what food you gonna get. So whatever you get you have to take it otherwise you lose your money. It is like Pandora's Box.

This app is supposed to link you to restaurants that are throwing waste food away, instead they just sell you the old food and still make a profit.    The only plus was Yo Sushi, they actually give you more because they know otherwise it's in the bin.

"Regarding TGTG Oslo Norway.  This started off as a concept where sellers and buyers could have a mutually beneficial deal, and at the same time save food from simply being thrown away. It started off well, but lately I have experienced several of the places I have shopped at to be using TGTG as a way to make money, doing little to battle food waste. Sentralen kafe sold me a sandwich for half price, Jaipur sold me the left over sauce from a chicken dish, Taverna'n sold me dry and half rotten leftovers from lunch, and today H√•ndverksbakeriet sold me a bread for full price, and gave me two brioche for free. I have sent complaints to TGTG, but I am not sure they are doing anything to battle this abuse of their own concept. I am uninstalling the app, since several businesses seem to be taking advantage instead of giving people lot of food for little money. This was (in their own words) what TGTG was supposed to be about. Such a pity, as it really was a brilliant idea that unfortunately started to get abused by our local food businesses.",1,Google,2017-06-28

Unfortunately, it's gone completely downhill from there.   Now, every available place has the same generic write up. You have absolutely no idea what you might be getting. And it also appears to me to be the same old (often chain) companies offering their chips are 10pm, which suggests that TGTG aren't doing enough to push their product and ethos.

"I love the idea of this app to fight against food waste and I really hope it'll end up being a great success. However, the app still needs some polishing to do before I can really tell is working well. As other people already said, it's a must to give the customer the option to sort by collection time AND to be able to identify vegetarian/vegan/free from options more clearly. For example, being vegetarian, it would be an issue for me to pay for something made with meat that, on top of everything, I will not eat -  which imo goes against the whole purpose of this app.",3,Google,2017-05-04

"Not that great to go more like I have had this app for a while but it‚Äôs took a few months to be able to obtain a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù bag, what a load of rubbish it was, it says on the post you get a mixture of meats bakery items eg cakes and bread fruit veg, all sounds really good.
So I finally get to reserve a bag at a local spar shop, got quite a big bag, me thinking nice one I‚Äôve got a bargain here, back in the car, can‚Äôt wait to get home to see what there is,
Well opened the bag 24 wildlife tube yoghurts , out of date the same day, considering it was 8pm that day by the time I got it home, the kids ate a couple rest in the freezer not sure if you‚Äôre supposed to, I also got pate, a tub of single cream, 2 chocolate trifles(mini ones) 2 profiteroles and soggy tub of melons, all of these had already been reduced to between 20p and 90p and out of date that day and the last thing was 12 tiger rolls, reduced to 90p each 6 pack but were already 2 days out of date
The price was ¬£3.09 for ¬£10 + worth of food, all the reduced stuff was barely ¬£6 at the most and I feel like I paid ¬£3 to just got get a bag of stuff to put in my own bin instead of the spar shops bin, definitely would not be going there again, I see so many people get good stuff I feel conned I must say",5,Apple,2021-02-27
"Barley Farm - Eccles This was the first time using the app. I was a little worried about collecting. I thought I‚Äôd have to explain about the app. etc, but there was a really lovely, friendly girl at the door. I got my phone out to show her, but she immediately asked, ‚ÄúIs it Too Good To Go?‚Äù I said it was. She then said I had to register for the Track & Trace app. or if I preferred, that she would bring it to my car. She was so lovely. I should have got her name so I could tell her manager. The food was in a large plastic box with a clear lid, and had a generous selection of vegetables, roast potatoes and mash. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long. She asked before she went to get it if I had anything I didn‚Äôt like. I said ‚Äúplenty of meat please, it‚Äôs for my son‚Äù  She explained that you don‚Äôt get meat unless it‚Äôs the end of service, so I guess this means if there was a later collection time slot. All in all, a good experience and I would use this service again. Lovely customer service from the young lady on the door.",5,Apple,2020-09-28
"Mixed review I like this idea, sometimes we get some great bits and sometimes alright bits, I have often found that most of the food is out of date the same day I buy it, we will only keep it until the next day, if bread goes off, the birds get it, if the veg becomes risky it goes in my composter. I have found that when I get sandwiches they get eaten for supper. We often get a little treat of some sort, that gets eaten that minute. Sometimes what we get in the magic bag is just extra food that we wouldn‚Äôt normally buy and sometimes we get food that will supplement a meal. I has helped my regular food last at bit longer and often it hasn‚Äôt.
We do love to get a bag and see what is in it. We have tried some different bags from different types of shops to see what we might get. It is always worth a try. Don‚Äôt expect a meal from greggs but I would expect a treat or two.",5,Apple,2021-11-04
"Good idea in theory, but flawed Just got the app really so I don‚Äôt have much to say about my own experience, but one of the first things I noticed is that you are very much at the whim of your location. For me, there is nothing in my immediate vicinity and I would have to go to the next town over just to get to the nearest place on the app. The town isn‚Äôt usually too far but even by car it‚Äôs at least 15 minutes away and I don‚Äôt drive to begin with. I don‚Äôt know about anyone else but I‚Äôm not hopping on a train just for to pick up a bag of mystery groceries.

As for some of the other reviews I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs a few other problems that are an issue, namely the places just exploiting it as an opportunity to make more money from offloading the unappealing stuff which would otherwise be thrown out. I get that we‚Äôre not paying store price for this stuff and that it‚Äôs the stuff that hasn‚Äôt sold at the end of the day, but still, bit of a dick move to give someone a stale muffin that nobody wants and then make them pay too much for it. 

They could show a picture of it so that we get to see if we‚Äôd actually be willing to pay the stated price for the item, either that or maybe temper the price by quality.",1,Apple,2019-09-07
"Outstanding! Used the app for the first time today and was amazed. It‚Äôs simple to use and navigate around. Unfortunately I live in a smaller town so there are very few restaurants or cafes signed up to the app, however, I knew this was likely before downloading the app. I‚Äôm happy to say that one of the local stores that has signed up is a very popular bakery. I choose to purchase one of their ‚Äòmagic bags‚Äô today. After reading the reviews, I was aware that the contents of a bag could be pleasing or disappointing, depending on the store. I therefore kept my expectations realistic and thought it would contain a sandwich or perhaps a croissant or two.  Boy, was I wrong! I left the bakery carrying two bags containing two sandwich croissants, a sourdough and prosciutto sandwich, half a filled baguette, a cinnamon and raisin swirl, a bagel, a focaccia loaf, two farmhouse loaves and eight seeded rolls! All for just ¬£3!  I will definitely be using the app often and happily!",5,Apple,2019-09-07
"Great idea for reducing food waste I was sceptical at first as I thought it would largely be iffy looking old food.... but I couldn‚Äôt be more wrong! Everything is really good quality often in date still just on the edge so the cafes and shops will not be able to legally sell it when they open the next day, but it‚Äôs still perfectly edible. Always get items worth at least double the value of the bag,
often much more. I used to work in a supermarket mainly restocking short date bakery items and I was always appalled by the sheer amount of food waste when we couldn‚Äôt sell stock before it‚Äôs use by date... so this is a really nifty solution! 
The app is tidy and really easy to use, and the company send really useful tips and tricks by email so this is one I am happy to be on the mailing list for.",5,Apple,2021-05-03
"Great! Ignore the bad reviews This app is actually really good. A must have if you think yourself environmentally-minded. Easy to collect and no embarrassment. I just wish more shops would sign up as it‚Äôs a win-win for everyone.

I think some of the people leaving bad reviews are missing the point - if you‚Äôre expecting the exact same meal/ your favourite items you would buy from the place then of course you will be disappointed! The idea is that you buy (at a very reduced price) food that no one else wants in order to stop it going into landfill. And if you live in a village then don‚Äôt be surprised if there‚Äôs not as much going as in cities. Also, driving 100 miles to pick up a bag of food is not good for the environment, just check the app every now and then and stay local.",5,Apple,2021-02-23
"Really misleading I can't speak for all food places but can only imagine the same or similar repeating elsewhere. 

A burger shop (Bunk Burgers) described 'wings and burgers' that you could rescue. Wings being a side this clearly indicated to me that I get a burger as well as wings - great! I go to the shop and they hand me the tied up bag which I returned home with only to find I was only given wings. No burger at all. 

It looks like shops are advertising all their best this things then giving the cheapest items they can get away with. 

Part of the Too Good To Go concept is that you get no choice or say in what you're given. That's understandable if it's only leftover food that'll go to waste but not reasonable if you go home with sides everytime you order a dinner.

I don't even think those wings would have gone to waste - they were made fresh when I went in. The price I was charged is almost the usual price considering it was just wings. To them it's just another deliveroo or just eat style order. Quite misleading. 

---

Update: The Too Good To Go customer service has refunded this purchase. I can't fault the service received from them. Will try again perhaps with a different restaurant and maybe it'll be a different experience. Changed to 5 stars for now.",5,Apple,2019-01-21
"Hit & Miss food I‚Äôve used this app to buy food from Costa Coffee,  Greggs & Dobbies. At first it was quite good with a selection of different foods in the bags, then Costa gave me a bagful of which if I was having a party would have been great but we couldn‚Äôt even give them away b4 they were stale which kind of defeats the object, greggs did exactly the same 2 bags of nothing but cakes and finally Dobbies, I picked up 2 bags from them and as soon as I had hold of them I knew I‚Äôd been taken for a ride, it would have all easily fitted into one bag and what was in there was disgusting, dead herbs for a start, I could have paid the full price and got fresh stuff, I complained to the app and they were not too happy once they saw the list and photos of ‚Äòfood‚Äô so they refunded me the price of one of the bags (thank you to them for that). Haven‚Äôt used the app since.",4,Apple,2021-04-27
"Surprisingly addictive Was forced to download one evening by a cafe that only had TGtG bags left. So glad they did. Amazingly value - and fun to see what you get in your magic bag - haven‚Äôt had a bad one yet. Obviously availability/quality must depend on your location - but use your nous - is it a nice place with daily fresh goods near its closing time? Then you are likely to win. Some places put the bag together when you‚Äôre there so you can be veggie / whatever - tonight the guy let me pick whatever I wanted from the display‚Ä¶and then forced more on me. I guess some time I will run out of luck - but I‚Äôve had so much value already, I couldn‚Äôt complain.

"Fantastic!!!‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è I‚Äôve been using this app for about three weeks now and I‚Äôve tried several different shops and cafes in different locations.  I can‚Äôt fault the app-it‚Äôs really easy to navigate and the food has been great.  

I live very close to several coffee shops and restaurants-the down side to this is that I mostly stick to the same places when I‚Äôm out and about.  With this app I‚Äôve been able to try lots of new places and discover and support local businesses I didn‚Äôt even know existed!

I‚Äôve picked up bags of food and desserts to the value of ¬£15-¬£20 for under ¬£5!  I‚Äôve only had one bag that I didn‚Äôt think was that  great-it was a boxed up meal from local shop which I thought was quite small.  When I asked what was inside they just said it‚Äôs vegetarian-but it tasted really good and the staff were very friendly.  I‚Äôve mostly used bakeries and coffee shops so I get lots of pastries bread and fancy  sandwiches which is great for a family on the go.  

In terms of developing the app-I would like to have the option to take my own packaging and inform the shops that I will be doing this.  The app does state that you can take your own Tupperware but the shops have often already boxed and bagged everything up when I arrive.",5,Apple,2019-07-13
"LOVE this app!! Absolutely love Too Good To Go! You can pick up fresh, tasty food for around 3-4x cheaper than usual supermarket, cafe or restaurant prices, all while saving on food waste! I recommend this to everyone, it is starting to catch on with more and more places joining the scheme even in more rural areas which is great üëçüèº my only suggestion as an improvement for the app team would be to have an option to receive a notification when one of your favourited places uploads new magic bags, as unless you check the app several times a day you can sometimes miss out which is a shame, as well as receiving a notification when a magic bag in your local area is unclaimed with less than an hour to go so that locals can go and save the food!",5,Apple,2021-05-12
"Ok but please offer more Vegan / Veggie options This is a fantastic app that I love and have had some really decent bits of food however, as a Vegan there just isn‚Äôt enough options. So when ordering a mystery bag you can get a heck load of meat and just have to take that gamble which is so unfortunate! I understand this may be down to stores but highly recommend it‚Äôs taken into consideration as I think they will sell like Hot cakes! If a restaurant offers vegan / veggie foods then there should be an option for a magic bag, yes there may not always be availability but there isn‚Äôt always with a regular bag. 

I work with someone (meat eater) who bought a magic bag that was full of vegan bits and they threw it all in the bin so it just completely defeats the object! I know not everyone will do this but it‚Äôs certainly something to think about! 

 Still a great app but that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt given it 5 stars.",3,Apple,2021-09-16
"Great idea , needs improvements on the app First of all, I want to say that the app is for such a good cause. I have downloaded it a week ago and have used it a few times, and each time has been a good for me, hence the 5 star rating. 

Some feedback for the app that I think that would benefit the experience: 
- Leaving reviews on different stores, I have had some varying customer service and quality of food given. Informative reviews such as images of food given to give an idea of food etc and not complaints to the company. 
- More of a description of the restaurant, such as images of what they do, sometimes I am skeptical to order from a store as I don‚Äôt know what they offer. I know that it is a ‚Äúgoody bag‚Äù but an idea of what to expect would be nice. 
- Option to categorise foods according to restaurant type. Etc Japanese food within Xkm to my area. Sometimes I would like to have a certain type of food on the day and would not mind travelling to a certain stop on the way. 
- Not something that you can really change on the app, but sometimes the staff of the restaurant have no idea about the app, so it can be quite awkward to collect. Maybe more awareness could be made for it ?",5,Apple,2019-05-05
"Initial Feedback I originally downloaded this some time ago, it was up and coming and very little uptake on the restaurants, one sushi place if I remember rightly so didn‚Äôt get to use it. 
I saw an advert this week and thought I‚Äôd give it another go. Very disappointed to see that there‚Äôs not many more to choose from in a city with over 800 eating establishments. Of the 10 or so listed, so far there‚Äôs only been 1 hotel and 2 Greene King pubs available, all the others say sold out but it says that all the time and the sold out time never changes so I very much doubt they were offering anything to begin with.
I can‚Äôt believe in a city that thrives on it‚Äôs dining scene that only two companies are actually offering food. I‚Äôd like to think if they aren‚Äôt using this idea they are instead giving it away to homeless shelters. It‚Äôs a great concept but disappointed in the uptake.",3,Apple,2020-02-29
"‚ÄòMagic‚Äô bag = rubbish bag I tried purchasing a ‚Äòmagic bag‚Äô from a high end bakery: 3 very miniature, dry and squashed cupcakes in a tiny box and a little bag of praline Easter eggs (3 weeks after Easter). No one would ever cough up 3 pounds for this literal rubbish, nor bother to pick it up. 

This app is such a good premise in theory, but by the sound of some of the reviews and my own experience, I suspect some vendors are using this as a way of getting rid of stock they are failing to sell, as opposed to stock that is desirable but won‚Äôt keep. And they seem to sell it at a higher price than they‚Äôd get if the goods were on display in their shop. So much for shops wanting to reduce waste... only as long as they can profit from their rubbish! This is only based on one try - but Im now highly sceptical and don‚Äôt fancy being ripped off again. 

The fact that shops don‚Äôt have to describe or photograph what they‚Äôre giving away is a huge flaw in this app, as is the fact that you can‚Äôt leave reviews and ratings.",2,Apple,2019-05-10
"No food left after purchasing, no communication I visited a yo!sushi store in Worcester on 2 occasions to be told they had no food left and they didn‚Äôt even notify us on both occasions. Asked TooGoodToGo if they would help the sending time around as we were out of pocket after x2 63 mile round trips to this store as there isn‚Äôt much choice in our area. We were told we could make another purchase and they would refund us which is really what we were expecting. We‚Äôve given up with this, even more disappointing that they have offered compensation to someone who left a similar review on here with a similar experience so clearly not consistent with their customer service. Hardly saving the environment as they boast after making 2 long and wasted trips for nothing is it! Pretty terrible experience really in all honesty, it‚Äôs not worth the hassle it would be cheaper to just pay full price, the wasted food is their problem if they can‚Äôt fulfill their promises.",1,Apple,2020-10-26
"Turned up, no food left and still no money back! Very disappointing first outing using this app. Paid for food at Bean at Princess Dock, Liverpool. Received email confirming purchase, all going well. Turn up on time only to be told no food left! Staff member was very apologetic but still a negative experience. And I‚Äôve still not received a refund! 
I don‚Äôt even know if this is normal practice? But if it is, it should be made clear on the website from the start. 
Also, the whole idea is to reduce or recoup the carbon footprint. But in reality, it‚Äôs just made it worth, travelling to the city wasting fuel, then leaving to go find food somewhere else.

Further review:

Dated 4/3/20- Hello. Well this is the second time I‚Äôve had this very disappointing experience in exactly the same place. As such I won‚Äôt use the company Bean again. I also couldn‚Äôt find anywhere in your help centre, FAQ‚Äôs etc that states that on occasion (or more often than not) eateries can run out of food and it‚Äôs just plain tough. I feel by not mentioning this anywhere in the app, you are giving your customers a very poor experience and not enabling them to make fact based decisions as to wether they place an order or not. I had to travel (once again) some distance to collect my non existent order which, meant the carbon footprint left by my vehicle did not help to save the environment or prevent waste. Your thoughts would be welcomed...again.",1,Apple,2020-03-04
"Brilliant app Had my first ‚Äúmagic bag‚Äù last weekend. Loads of delicious food for a very small amount of money. 
Only negative was that the collection time slot moved to 30 minutes earlier than originally set by the business within 40 minutes of the original collection time(was meant to collect at 8:30-9:00 pm update came in at 7:50 pm that the collection time was now 8:00-8:30 pm). So it ended up being a rush to get to the place on time. Improvements I would suggest is making the collection time change option longer. As people prepay it‚Äôs not always possible to just drop everything with 10 minutes notice. 
Another thing I would really like is the option to setup my own alerts, e.g. if any of my ‚Äúfavourites‚Äù become available so I don‚Äôt have to check the app constantly.",4,Apple,2020-02-15
"Poor customer service Food is a bit hit and miss - I‚Äôve had some good meals and also paid ¬£3 for a bag of bread rolls that were growing green mould the next day (collected at 4pm).
Last weekend I ordered and paid for a meal, waited until 9pm to eat, drove to collect it and found the shop closed. After knocking on the door I spoke to the manager who said they had been closed for refurbishment for 3 weeks and he had no idea why Too Good To Go had taken my order. I was left hungry when it was too late to buy from anywhere else on a Sunday night, and they had already taken my money. 
The I sent a message to customer service to complain and have heard nothing - they did refund my money but I haven‚Äôt had a word of apology, explanation or even any kind of acknowledgment that I had my time wasted and was really messed about.
Not sure I‚Äôll use this App again it seems to be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.",2,Apple,2021-03-02
"Brilliant. This app is brilliant and good for people on low budgets who like to eat out and try different places but can't afford to. We have so far only used it once and that was with a pastry shop. They give you a set time when you have to go with your bag and then they fill it up with what ever is left over and not sold during the day. We got fresh bread, cheese rolls, pastries and a fresh bread stick and they would last a couple of days and are still very fresh when you take them home even more fresh then the sandwiches that I have brought from supermarkets. I highly recommend people to take a look and give it a try. The only tip I have is you need to check early each day to get the best places or they sell out.",5,Apple,2018-07-21
"Great initiative and important to support This app aims to address the huge waste issues that we have and gives the consumer a chance to support directly with retailers. I love the magic box concept, especially as someone often paralysed by the sheer choice of food on offer. Being given no choice is ironically sometimes the most liberating of experiences. The amount given in the box is often generous and retailers genuinely seem to appreciate the support reducing waste. 

In terms of app design, there are some improvements to be made: namely, the home page should ideally be a default list of options of food according to locality and time so you get a quick scan of what‚Äôs on offer. It feels over complicated at the moment with too many options and repeated offers. That said, there are good search options but would prefer a simple default.

The other issue is being able to add a built in reminder beforehand and calendar event easily. Would be good to have that as an option immediately after ordering rather than just sharing via social media. 

Overall, a great app that has led me to explore more of my local area and shops, making me more likely to try them out in the future.",4,Apple,2020-08-29
"Good Idea, But Needs Some Tweaks Living in a rural town there aren‚Äôt lots of options and more than 50% seems to be complete meals in my area rather than groceries, and I‚Äôve yet to be able to access the grocery store, even following the instructions from the team who manage the app it seems impossible.
Additionally there is a ratings box, but you can‚Äôt drill down to get more information, so for example it might say 93% of customers rate this supplier three stars or more, but there‚Äôs no way to know if that‚Äôs all bar one customer rating 3 out of 5.
It‚Äôs a great concept but still needs a bit of work.
Just reduced my rating as I‚Äôve been watching the magic bag for Morrison‚Äôs this evening and it went from sales ended at 18:17 (the previous days sales slot) to sales ended for today without there being a window in which I could even attempt to purchase. Deleting the app, life‚Äôs too short.",2,Apple,2020-09-07
"Dissapointed I can't trust an app which relies upon clients missing the times for collecting their items as a part of their business model. I was less than 10 minutes late because of an emergency that came up, I wrote to them asking to please change my order for some other time, but they offered no further help and just kept my money. I would have understood if they kept a fraction of what I paid as a penalty, or if they did this with someone who repeatedly missed their items, but this would have been the first time I'd done anything like that after having used the app 4-5 times before, and the situation really wasn't under my control. People use this app mainly because they're on a budget, so this experience was extremely frustrating. The client support I received after having my very first problem wasn't nice. They lost my trust. Be careful.",2,Apple,2019-11-24
"Differences I used this app in Germany before and now after moving to UK I decided to try it out. Comparing to Germany I think in UK companies don‚Äôt really understand the concept properly. Feels like here they try to sell what they have for a bit better price. 
In Germany it was different if you collect so called ‚ÄúGoody bag‚Äù it was goody bag pack of loads of different items. Everything what was left over and couldn‚Äôt be sold and would go to bin otherwise. Here in UK the goody bags are so much smaller and not necessarily items what they would otherwise bin or not able to sell. 
But I think it‚Äôs a good start and I hope companies will actually understand what the purpose of the app.",5,Apple,2021-02-22
"It‚Äôs ok My first experience I‚Äôve ordered was good and worth it for what I got for the sushi, I was happy with what I got. Second time was at a different place, disappointing for what it states in the advert you get nothing on the list for what it‚Äôs mentioned, portion size was little for discounted price, poor quality of food. Third time I used disappointed in the portion size again, states in advert that you get to pick the food of Buffett from mixture of combination of choices but yet they picked the least that don‚Äôt nobody wants and portions size for what I was meant to be getting for ¬£15 worth paid ¬£5 less than what I expected.
Change of reviews, they got intouch and dealt with my problem and I appreciated that, thank you and for that I will reconsider try again hopefully it will be a better next experience",3,Apple,2020-01-25
"Live Notifications Please! Downloaded this app a few days ago and, although up until now I‚Äôve only collected one bag, thus far I am impressed. Easy collection, good value for money, plus it saves the food from being binned, always a plus. 

One thing I would say is that it gets a bit confusing trying to keep track when favourite stores upload their bags. Why are there not notifications for this? Seems a simple implementation - favourite a store, get notified when bags go live. I realise there might be a bit of a rush for popular stores but at the moment I keep missing things as I can‚Äôt be staring at the app all day. 

Otherwise v impressed.",5,Apple,2021-10-22
"Poorly organised I‚Äôve made four orders through the app - two worked as they should, in that you pay slightly less than face value for whatever the restaurant would have thrown away. The other two cancelled after I had paid, saying they didn‚Äôt have food left over. This would be okay if the notification came instantly upon ordering, but it doesn‚Äôt. 

The nature of the app means you can only pick up food late, meaning you have to plan to eat much later than usual dinner hours. So when you wait well past dinner time, and are only then told the food you paid for isn‚Äôt available after all, it is disruptive. Although I was refunded, the app needs to discourage restaurants from advertising food they will not actually provide.

It is also not very useful without the option to sort by closest distance.",2,Apple,2021-06-29
"Easy way to do good! I was suspicious of this app when I first heard of it but have now used it to collect 7 bags and it‚Äôs been brilliant beyond expectations!! Only once was I ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù because there weren‚Äôt as many goodies in a Greggs bag but the rest of the food was still good quality!! 
Today I got 3 bags from 2 different supermarkets and what I got was like doing a full shop! Dinner, desert and breakfast for 4 people as well as extras to put towards tomorrow‚Äôs dinner with veg to share with my local Scottish SPCA!! If you‚Äôre toying with the idea of trying it I say go for it! Takes the planning out of dinner, gives you a surprise and saves food from going to waste!",5,Apple,2021-08-25
"A great idea but‚Ä¶ I love the idea of reducing food waste (and saving a few pennies along the way) but I was pretty disappointed with my first bag. It was from a local garage that has an M&S shop, so all the food was M&S (great!) but it was 10pm and all use by that day! So although we kept tomatoes and doughnuts, the spaghetti carbonara, chicken wrap and peppercorn sauce have all gone in the bin today because we weren‚Äôt sure if we could safely eat them the day after their use by (not best before) as they contained chicken, cream etc‚Ä¶. A great idea but a bit flawed - the company can probably now crow that they are saving carbon but in reality half has gone in someone‚Äôs home bin! Perhaps companies could be told to ensure they distribute the food before most people‚Äôs normal dinner time?  Not many will make a meal at 10pm.",3,Apple,2021-10-21
"Poor value, questionable quality, peculiar timings, frugal quantities and odd selection. Gave up using the app after three attempts. First order was cancelled but the app didn‚Äôt show the status. Second attempt resulted in a mish mash of the odd bit of wrinkled fruit and a pepper and a couple of stale cakes (chucked in the same bag) for which I like a mug had paid ¬£3.00 for. Third go I was the unfortunate recipient of ¬£3.00 worth of four inedible out of date gluten free cakes (inedible because they were full of E numbers and preservatives) and a loaf of bread. (Actually bread was ok).

I saved the shop declaring it as waste and throwing the cakes away because I did it for them. 

The operation of the process seems counter intuitive.  It seems that rather than posting the food waste left overs at the end of the day my experience was that they came on stream at random times sometimes first thing in the morning. Thats if you can find any in your area at all.

I would have been better off going to Aldi spending my ¬£3.00 and getting my choice of fresh more nutritious food in larger quantities. 

The problem with this idea is that there are just to many variables to satisfy users - value, quality, timing, quantity and selection, all of which (for me) were lacking.

Maybe I was just unlucky.",1,Apple,2021-01-19
"Amazing!!!! The whole experience was incredibly straight forward - although I‚Äôd definitely recommend reading the directions on the app rather than just using sat nav. The staff at the warehouse were really friendly and it‚Äôs a well rehearsed operation. The selection of food in the family box was great too, with something for everyone! 

But all of this ignores the whole point of this set up - to stop waste hitting the landfills. That in itself makes this one of my favourite apps ever, knowing we can all do our bit to help the planet. Highly recommend - great value, good choice of food and drinks and all helping keep landfill waste to a minimum",5,Apple,2021-06-13
"Excellent Food, Excellent Serviceüëå This was my first purchase and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It was simple and straight forward to order, the order was waiting for me when I got there, the lady was lovely and the food was not only excellent quality and delicious but it was also abundant and I was able to share it with a homeless guy so we both had a great breakfast and it was not only lovely to share the food but to enjoy each other‚Äôs company as well. I can‚Äôt stop sharing the ap with others now. It‚Äôs a win win win situation. Super well done to whoever came up with this idea and the people who are getting on board with it.

"Great idea but improvements needed I love this app, it‚Äôs great to see food waste in Bristol being addressed, and I love feeling like I‚Äôve got a bargain. Plus it encourages you to try other things you might not have ordered before! 

The problem is that being Vegan means what‚Äôs left over isn‚Äôt always something I can eat. I would make sense to have separate vegan purchases available for places that have large vegan menus, or the restaurant should be able to post what is left at the end of the day so that it‚Äôs obvious when vegan options are available.

A friend of mine also bought a meal that she was unable to redeem as it was for a food stall that just wasn‚Äôt set up that day.",5,Apple,2018-09-30
"Good idea but... I think this app is a brilliant idea but it seems in my area the all the local Morrison‚Äôs bags are bought every day a few minutes into the next day, every day, (theyre the only multiple stores that use the app in my area) and the app seems to take a while to update to the next day for me. So they‚Äôre always bought out by 6:19pm for tomorrow at the latest, the end of when you can pick up the food is 6pm for this day...  I was under the impression that the next day would be past midnight surely? It just feels slightly unfair when most days I don‚Äôt even see the bag available before they‚Äôre sold. I‚Äôm happy the food is being used though don‚Äôt get me wrong. :)",4,Apple,2019-11-20
"Brilliant idea! The only thing I can say is that more stores & restaurants should definitely get involved. If food is going to be disposed of anyway, why not get at least some revenue from it? From an environmental point of view and also socially, it‚Äôs such a great idea! It really would be good to see some more big names getting on board.
We had a carvery last night for ¬£3.20 each which was perfect as I knew we were coming home late anyway. It benefits me and also the restaurant and the quality was still great. So easy to use the app too, pay for your meal in advance then just swipe the app to redeem once at the venue",5,Apple,2019-12-05
"¬£3.09 food collection This is my second box both very different in contents.  On the first one I was lucky enough to have a piece of cheese in it whilst the second was purely fruit and vegetables.  Everything was very fresh, however, what I am going to do with six cucumbers I‚Äôm not quite sure.  On both occasions I was very pleased with what I was given and the staff were very nice.  However, my only gripe is they never seem to have a box made up.  I had to wait over an hour for the first one and twenty minutes for the second.  A painful experience  but  worth waiting for in the end.  Many thanks to Morrisons for being so kind.",5,Apple,2020-07-02
"Bad experience with one of the shops on here. It was a popular service station, I arrived at the southbound as described on the app. The lady behind the counter shouted at me straight away when I said I was here for a too good to go order. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to check these emails‚Äù she shouted. After a few mins her colleague told me to go across to the northbound, which I did. On arriving to northbound the man behind the counter asked me to go back to southbound, explaining the order had nothing to do with him. Only after being more firm about them messing me around did they tell me to wait whilst someone drove over from the other side, making out like I was the problem. 

I don‚Äôt like that the app put me through that experience. I tried a few nights prior with a different retailer and they were fine, but tonight all staff involved verged on hateful that I was even there.",1,Apple,2021-02-15

"Slick interface, sometimes confusing I really love this app. It does so many amazing things and makes buying treats you couldn‚Äôt normally afford, affordable. 

The most frustrating thing has to be the front page. I swear the different headlines change every time to use the app. 

It would be amazing if you could make your own filters and save them. For example if I‚Äôm at work I‚Äôd love to be able to have a set filter that shows me all the places near me with goody bags available right now. It seems obvious but it doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs anything like that right now as the discover section is a bit convoluted and requires lots of changes.",4,Apple,2021-11-19
"Amazing value I find the too good to go app fantastic. I get my magic bags mostly from Greggs. It feeds my hubby his snapping for work the next day and treats for the kids. Amazing value for money paid and knowing I am helping the environment is a plus too. The staff are always friendly in Greggs northop hall Flintshire and happy to help and always greet me with a smile. The magic bag contains items I wouldn‚Äôt normally buy as I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd like them, so it also helps to promote Greggs food by letting my family sample items to see if they like them. The pot meals are great and really healthy too. I would recommend it to everyone to give it a go.",5,Apple,2021-06-24
"Has revolutionised my lunch breaks - awesome Fantastic service. Tried for first time today and as it is day one I‚Äôm going large.

Started off with breakfast from Novotel (London City South) (¬£3). In the box: 6 assorted mini croissant, two rolls, salami slices, ham slices, block of Camembert cheese, cucumber slices, tomato slices, piece of butter. So a lot of food for one person. 

Lunch from Laffa (Flat Iron Square, London), grilled halloumi and aubergine, mixed salad, sauces and lentils, also ¬£3. Delicious. Usual price ¬£6.50.

Finishing off with a selection of cakes from Konditor and Cook (London Bridge) this evening to take home, also ¬£3.

So I‚Äôve spent ¬£9 today eating from places I would never normally eat at during the day. If I stick to a budget of ¬£6 a day (what I typically spend) I‚Äôm happy with that.

I‚Äôm factoring in having the occasional meal that doesn‚Äôt quite fit with what I‚Äôd normally pick but what do you want for that amount of money.

In short this app is brilliant. Some areas with have a huge choice (London Bridge in my case) other less urban areas perhaps less so. 

An absolute must have download 5/5.",5,Apple,2018-10-16
"Easy to use and support something important Easy to use the app. Made a really good concept what I‚Äôd like to see growing. 
It‚Äôs not a complicated app and it doesn't have to be. You know where to find every that you need, payments are really easy and collections are quick. 
I like you can write reviews about places where you pick up your food, I think that's very important and it also has a map which shows you the location via Google maps or apple map.

I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but I was very pleasantly surprised. This tea shop was a lovely, cosy place right in the centre of Nechells; never heard of it before but would definitely visit for a coffee and a slice of cake! Two very weighty goody bags came my way (which was a relief). The shepherd‚Äôs pie was as good as my mum makes and the array of other goodies soon disappeared.

The places I have been have all been friendly and happy to see me doing my bit. The breakfasts in big hotel chains have been best so far, well that was until last night when I visited pizza punks glasgow, wow this is a top end trendy place to get a pizza.

"Very good start! The app is a good start of an anti food waste revolution that is long overdue. At the same time we need to fight rubbish ‚Äì so an option to say ‚ÄúI'll bring my own containers/Do not pre-package for me‚Äù is much needed. What I find tricky is that shops ‚Äúknow‚Äù already in the morning how much food they will have left over. I think we need something more spontaneous, e.g. shops put food online near EOB, when they can actually see how much they have sold and how much they have left over. It is probably different every day. This could be picked up before they close or the next morning (most food items are perfectly fine the next morning).",4,Apple,2020-09-17
"Needs custom notifications Really good concept of an app but places I want to buy from are always sold out and I wish I could put notifications on for that place when they are available to buy from so I don‚Äôt miss the chance

I also wish that there was an option to not include certain items of food, you can write if you have an allergy but you have to sort it out with the individual shop whereas I wish you could just let them know through the app, I don‚Äôt eat this kind of meat etc etc 
I haven‚Äôt ordered from a restaurant but maybe label what‚Äôs in each thing so you don‚Äôt eat something you‚Äôre not meant to",4,Apple,2020-03-12
"Such wasted potential This app has the potential to be amazing, but right now it's of little use to me.. You can't filter by vegetarian options, and if you search an area and click on a restaurant, then come back to the search menu, it clears your search results and tells you to enable GPS. You have to try a few times to cancel, as it won't even cancel the previous search (words) straight away, and then search again.

Maybe I'll download again in the future once some substantial changes have been made, but for now it's not for me..

Update: After receiving a reply stating that it is possible to filter by vegan options, I tried again and even contacted customer services, only to be told that the reply was sent by someone in the Denmark team and doesn't apply to the UK version. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So no, we can't filter by began/vegetarian options.",1,Apple,2017-09-23
Great idea but lacking notification function. I have been trying to get one local shop for about 2 weeks. Says it‚Äôs sold out between 6 and 6:15 everyday so I come on and I‚Äôm not sure if the app isn‚Äôt refreshing or there isn‚Äôt stock and it‚Äôs just saying sales ended then changes to sold out 10 minutes later. It‚Äôs really annoying as it would be good if the app actually sent a notification of the availability rather than having to keep setting an alarm to go on at the same time every day to get the same message when I could just look for the notification telling me then go on the app.,4,Apple,2020-09-17

"Read about in a Guardian article So I found out about this app after reading an article in the guardian regarding minimising food waste, so with nothing to lose I thought I‚Äôd download and see how good this could really be. 
I found that one of my favourite restaurants (Yo!Sushi) was lister on there. As a regular diner in Yo! Anyway I know the food good and the fact that I wouldn‚Äôt know what I would receive didn‚Äôt phase me, I like everything on their menu anyway!
So all ordered and ready to go, I get there and the lady looks at me. She doesn‚Äôt have a clue what this service is and has nothing to give me!
Now if I order and pay for something in advance, I expect it to be there when I get there, don‚Äôt waste my time by having me get in my car, park, walk to the restaurant to be told sorry the food you already paid for does not exist.
I provided feedback to toogoodtogo, they didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the issue just said they‚Äôd refund what I‚Äôd paid, no consideration for the inconvenience caused or even an apology!
So in short, we had dominos for dinner last night, I collected so only cost ¬£9.99 and the food was there when I got there, I won‚Äôt be using this app again and unless you want to be let down dramatically I‚Äôd save your time and order a nice fresh dominos!",1,Apple,2019-07-26
"Customer service from your partners will be the downfall. Great concept, being destroyed by the companies you‚Äôre working with. 

I have tried this app four times now and only once been successful. 

Being a Muslim, I expected to be at least given a vegetarian option, so ordering my ‚Äúmystery bag‚Äù I went into the store collect to find that my only options were ham sandwiches or chicken and bacon sandwiches? Luckily, the barista was helpful and offered a refund and told me that in future, maybe go to the store first before purchasing to see what they have a available.

I have a severe intolerance to seafood and in a different bakery I went to try the next time, I explained my allergies and asked if they had options where I could avoid the seafood- they still had loads on offer. I asked if I could have a couple of the vegetarian baguettes and the woman at the counter told me I would ‚Äúget what I was given‚Äù. I said okay, that‚Äôs fine but I have a severe allergy to fish. 

Her response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you whatever I want. It‚Äôs a mystery bag and you‚Äôll have to have what I pick. You don‚Äôt get to choose‚Äù

"Waste of time I used the app for the first time today and was really excited that my local big budgens store is selling bakery and veg/fruit bags. Ordered 2 bags ¬£1.99 each. Walked more than a mile at night and store had no idea what I am talking about. Another girl had the same problem. Manager came and she had no idea what we want and never heard about the app. So wasted my time, paid ¬£4 not to mention walking at night. And even then app was saying that bags are available for collection and you still could buy them. And sent me invoices for my purchase like I collected products.
Why you advertise that there is 3 bags available if store manager says that she never heard of it and has nothing going out of date? More communication would be great. Thank god I didn‚Äôt choose a restaurant 3 miles away
Update: why it shows that I rated it 5* if I gave 1*?!!!",1,Apple,2019-06-30
"Great idea I do like the idea of getting food for cheap that would normally be thrown away by shops for being past their sell by date. Or pubs for carverys they didn‚Äôt sell. We have even used this app whilst away in the caravan. Sometimes I‚Äôve been lucky and got a bag full of pork chops, lamb kebabs and punnets of mushroom and others mainly bags of bread and a packet of radishes. But as I work with a lovely crew of people- what I do eat - they have and we all trade so nothing gets binned. I have shared this app with all my friends and family and as times are hard for some families- this also helps",5,Apple,2021-08-12
"Great app I downloaded the app a couple of weeks ago and was looking forward to trying out a few outlets. I live in a small town and the majority of the businesses onboard are in the city.

 I was delighted when Morrisons appeared on the list and have spent the past week trying to buy a Magic Box - they‚Äôre either just sold out or not available - until last evening: success! 

I picked up the box today without any problem and was very pleased. I received a large celebration cake, bread, bagels, baking potatoes, salad leaves and a pineapple. All the items were in very good condition and looked fresh. 

It must be my lucky week as I‚Äôve managed to buy another box at a Morrisons in the nearby larger town which I‚Äôll be collecting tomorrow. 

I‚Äôm so pleased I downloaded this app and would definitely recommend it as it gives consumers the opportunity to try products they wouldn‚Äôt usually buy plus reduces waste. Thank you, developers.",5,Apple,2019-12-05
"Good idea but don‚Äôt bank on getting your bag Good idea to help reduce food waste but we‚Äôre very unhappy. We were scanning the app last night until somewhere near us had a bag going. After an hour of the app saying check back soon (delayed) we got one and another somewhere else. Sadly this morning one of them cancelled our order as nothing left over. Then just now before leaving to collect our other bag, they cancelled too. Sure, no food waste and it‚Äôs only a little bit of food but the system is pretty poor. I guess the vendors are to blame for saying ‚Äòwe have three bags‚Äô and then cancelling. They shouldn‚Äôt be able to do that? Someone could be relying on the bag for their evening meal or something. I think you guys (the app) need to enforce tighter rules over the vendors to be accurate.",1,Apple,2021-06-26
"Great idea - however... I‚Äôve been unable to use this great little app so far, as the only shops anywhere near me that take part are Morrisons (and they‚Äôre still 15 mins drive) - which somehow seem to sell out of items before I‚Äôve even seen them. Any other places I‚Äôve heard of are too far away and offer pickup too late for me as I have a baby at home in bed at that time.

It‚Äôs a great idea, but maybe there should be some sort of notification system when the stores nearest me put something up? Or could there be a way to limit repeat purchases for customers to give the rest of us a chance to even try it? As I‚Äôm assuming this is what‚Äôs happening by me.",3,Apple,2019-12-17
"Amazing sushi! First time of using Too Good To Go. Had read reviews and understood that it was pot luck as to what was left at stores. My time slot was 21h30-22h00. I arrived at 21h33. The lady in the front counter said that there was only one thing left in the refrigerated pre-packed boxes. Chicken, avocado with Parmesan, 4/5 sushi rolls with rice. She asked the Manager what they did for Too Good to Go purchases and she said that I could have the cold box, or 4 items from the food belt.
I came away with beetroot cured salmon sashimi, coriander seared tuna sashimi, dragon rolls, salmon sashimi.
It cost me ¬£3.50. Store price would have been around ¬£23, on offer nights around &¬£15. It was delicious!",5,Apple,2019-09-10
"Fantastic concept Fantastic idea & although it is brilliant I do have a couple of small gripes which should by far not take away from the great app & idea , itself but more for the restaurant‚Äôs themselves.
1 some different ( big name) chains give far more, decent food & much wider range of food than others.
I also was told by staff they spread the bags so one person can‚Äôt order more than 1 & when you have a large family sharing a bag between them can put people off which then defeats the object.
Absolutely fantastic idea though ü§©üåûü§©.",5,Apple,2021-07-09
"Stretching the food I will use the app again to see if it is just certain places who give extremely small portions. 
We ordered an Indian and whilst the food was incredibly tasty (a tiny madras sauce and rice) the portion we received was beyond small. It was tiny. It was enough for my 1 year old sons tea. 
The value of the meal we received was ¬£10 to which we paid ¬£3.50. The value of the meal we received WAS ¬£3.50. 
There were many people waiting for these bags and you could obviously see that they had split the food down into so many tiny packages, to make more money. 
I don‚Äôt doubt the amazing reviews are reflective of amazing cafes and restaurants who are doing it right. 
I left a review for the place. I gave the food top marks but the portions 1 star. Its disappointing to see you CAN NOT see this review on the app. 
I think it would be a great idea to see the reviews of the place and at least you will know what you are getting and the experience of other users. 
I understand it‚Äôs a new App and feedback will help progress it. So having read other feedback of this nature, I think having the reviews of partaking restaurants would be really helpful",2,Apple,2019-08-11
"Quite pleased would definitely repeat Was a bit concerned how is it going to go and that I would be given scraps.
However quite pleased, was given a clean decent sized box the lady put a warm Yorkshire pudding and gammon in it and encouraged me to help myself with the rest of the carvery table(roasted veggies etc.). Was also given a separate pot for the gravy which I found extremely thoughtful.
The quantity of food I got was more than enough for one person.
5 stars for the Too good to go app and 5 stars for the Nickelodeon!
Will definitely be using the app again and will make sure to update my post :)",5,Apple,2019-08-16
"So Great! I have been using this app once a week for several months and always look forward to seeing what is in my bag!
The app is stable and easy to use. Unlike so many apps this has never crashed on me!
One thing I would ask for consideration is a way to link it to the calendar when I have ordered something with a 15 minute warning (customisable maybe for those who need 1/2 hour to 1 hr notice?) rather than the push notifications that only tell me I‚Äôve ordered something.... well duh I remember doing that!",5,Apple,2021-01-14
"If you like rotten food, wasting your time and losing money The rating system doesn‚Äôt allow for you to get a good sense of whether it‚Äôs the type of food you want. There are no metrics for assessing whether food is actually being saved once it reaches the consumer. I feel like most stuff is just rotten and I bin it myself, so that‚Äôs not ‚Äúending food waste‚Äù, it‚Äôs passing the buck and I get to pay for the privilege. Now, some companies give food out that is  probably perfectly sellable, that‚Äôs nice for the customer. Others give away rotting food that you immediately have to bin. I am done with the lottery. I would support a company that could provide more guarantees on the quality of the food you‚Äôre going to receive.",2,Apple,2021-08-20
A feel good no brainer I love that this app has come into the world. Providing discount so people can afford to eat a meal at a super cheap price while avoiding wasted food. The only app development I would suggest is (I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs there right now) is to be able to add your favourite places/food options to dine and then select to get notifications when an offer comes up. Also (again I don‚Äôt think this is there right now) gift vouchers could really work to give people the opportunity to buy many meals for someone for less.,5,Apple,2019-12-11
"Lifesaver, money saver and food saver! This app is wonderful! The extremely positive aspects of the app: wide variety of choice, continuous availability of offers, high quality food and service and preventing food waste. However, the greatest highlight for me is the value for money. I have never spent more than ‚Ç¨5 at any one time but usually have enough food to last 2-3 meals. The only thing I would say is the availability of food and diversity of choice varies according to country and city. Nevertheless, this app is still an amazing discovery.",5,Apple,2019-12-13
"To good to be true. The app is advised as a way of stopping food waste and being green, but that‚Äôs just lies and green washing. 
The app is just a way of getting you to buy your own samples! It‚Äôs a way to get you in the door so they can give you a TV shopping style pitch about all their food. 
Just think about it, how can they know how much waste food they are going to have at the start of the day? They can‚Äôt know. So why can you reserve ‚Äúsave food waste‚Äù at the start of the day? That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs nothing about saying food and everything about selling you stuff! 
If they actually wanted to save food they would let you know at the end of the day! 
This app is just a lie, it makes you feel like your saving the world by stopping waste, when your just not.",1,Apple,2021-05-26
"Made for city folk I downloaded this having high hopes. As someone who produces very little food waste (and 90% of that goes in my compost) I was looking for a great way to help others do the same. I was sad to see that this is an app made for cities.
Best you don‚Äôt live outside one of our major conurbations or you‚Äôll kill the planet emitting kilos of burnt carbon to get to the nearest place taking part.
Come along people, you need to promote this to local businesses, thus far all it seems to have is a bunch of multi-nationals adding to their green credentials. For it to be truly of value it needs to work right down to street level.
You could get crowd help you expand this, give us a downloadable pdf of a leaflet and we could do our bit by printing it and delivering it to locally owned businesses who we know share our ethics.",1,Apple,2019-08-05
"Ingredients and Allergens Every time I try to use the app it never ever gives you a list of ingredients and allergens so as a person who has a peanut allergy I think it‚Äôs really important if I know what I‚Äôm getting contains nuts!!! All it ever says when you click on the ingredients and allergens is ‚ÄòYour magic bag is a surprise.‚Äô So I‚Äôm expected to call around to each store to see what their ingredients are on a daily basis. Surely they‚Äôll have a slight indication of the food they will be making available that day to be able to update their ingredients on the app. Also why does the app even have an option for ingredients and allergens if it‚Äôs not even going to provide any help?!

Kept this for a month but I‚Äôm throwing in the towel. Pointless for someone like me.",1,Apple,2020-12-02
"Fight food waste and grab a bargain Downloaded this app ages ago as I hate food waste. I haven‚Äôt found many places in my local area until today. I managed to get a 6 inch cake worth ¬£25 for just ¬£8.00. The items are amazing and it saves them going into the bin at the end of the day, and doesn‚Äôt leave the business out of pocket. 
This app is a great idea and I hope more businesses join soon

Would be good to add and element to the app of how much food waste, water etc. You have saved as a result of your purchases. Your impact would be a great thing to see.",5,Apple,2019-10-29
"Tried and tested! So I tried the app for the first time today with a little bakery round the corner from my flat. I‚Äôd never been in until today as I always thought it looked a little too fancy and posh (I‚Äôm a northerner used to Greggs!). I paid ¬£3 and got given six humongous, delicious pastries and cakes! The quality was incredible and selected from the counter. I will definitely be using this app on a regular basis....although it‚Äôs going to be hard to avoid pastry temptation everyday!! Brilliant concept and a great way to try out local places you‚Äôve not tried before.",5,Apple,2019-08-28
"Not impressed yet. So I‚Äôve been told about this app from a work colleague. I‚Äôve ordered three times from stores that on the app says that they have an amount available, yet each time it gets to within around half hour or less for my collection time, the order gets cancelled citing ‚Äúno food available‚Äù. 
That‚Äôs fair enough. But why say available earlier on in the day, take payment then cancel? I know I get refunded but it all just seems to be a complete waste of time.",5,Apple,2021-10-12
"Dispointing, a mis-sell & not reducing waste This app is claiming to reduce food waste but you are getting food straight off the counter and not food that would be disposed of that day. The food we got (from Paul‚Äôs) was good value in context (¬£3.95 for ¬£10 worth of goods) but it was not what I hoped, which would be say four or five sandwiches which really had to be thrown away today. Instead it was one sandwich, one cake and one pastry, no good for feeding a family for example. The other place we went to was unable to redeem the voucher due to a timing error on the app so we walked all the way there but were unable to get anything. We were refunded quickly and I assume they will fix the issue. Love the concept but not good value nor environmental friendly.",2,Apple,2019-04-09
"Great Goodie Bag I was introduced to the app by son‚Äôs partner and once installed I was a bit slow starting but my daughter also started using it so I decided to have a go.
It was easy to use and I went to the store where the staff were really helpful. I was totally amazed at the volume of food in the bag for the amount I paid. 
My hubby was equally impressed so we will definitely be using the process again as it will help us make our budget go further as well as reducing food waste. Totally brilliant üëçüèªüòÉ",5,Apple,2021-07-12

"Lives up to the name Wasnt sure how this worked at first but now that I have tried it, it really makes sense. Apparently different restaurants will have differents ways of working, but so far, based on my limited experience with the app, it is very good value for very good food that is, indeed, too good to go. The model is good for the restaurants which can sell what wouldnt be sold anymore, good for customers which get very good value for the food (and trust me, very good food, literally the same as if you were going to the restaurant normally), and good for the planet.",5,Apple,2019-07-23
"Mixed experience Some places give you the out of date items they were selling cheap anyway which may have cost less than the app price, once got two enormous bags of soggy conference pears that had to go straight in the bin. Other places are better but you can end up with just a bag of cakes, or just veg past it‚Äôs best. 
My local Morrison‚Äôs is on the app but shows sold out without ever lighting up as available- I‚Äôm sure that one is rigged for an insider - the small local independent bakeries are the best they seem to get the whole idea behind the scheme. I‚Äôm cutting back on using the app for all the above reasons.",3,Apple,2021-08-20
"This is a lottery - not an alternative for a decent shop I downloaded this because of the box Morrison‚Äôs has rolled out. I can only access one store as I am visually impaired. It is luck who refreshes quick enough to get the box from my local Morrison‚Äôs. As this was my raison d‚Äôetre for signing up, that I cannot ever get anywhere, and after three fruitless days of trying this fad I give this up as a bad joke. There‚Äôs always plenty in the reduced aisle of my local Morrison‚Äôs that I can ‚Äòrescue‚Äô anyway so not worth the stress. I notice that there is no shortage of ‚Äòcrap‚Äô you can rescue from pubs, restaurants and cafe‚Äôs without this problem, but one cannot live on treats alone!

"Good for some, pointless for others Good app, does what it says and in a city or large town works perfectly.
There is however the small number of shops that are signed up, but the local staff have no idea what the app is, or that is advertised as selling out from the very same shop for the past month with a daily update on the app. Staff say food is binned with chemicals (floor cleaner) to prevent homeless taking it out...
Clearly the larger head office is using the app to appear as if they save more food than they bin, not on and if someone so big is doing it, who else is.
My experience is with a well known baked foods shop",3,Apple,2021-05-23
"Bad meal deal Fantastic premise, and love the idea of the app. Sadly, first go and huge bust. Paid ¬£3.29 and received a sandwich and cookie from Michaels. When I arrived, they asked me what my order was and seemed confused by the app. They shoved a sandwich and a cookie in the bag as though it was Deliveroo. There were still plenty of sandwiches still on the shelf and the man thought it was some sort of random pot luck app for indecisive people. Ended up with no saving and a dry sandwich. Don‚Äôt think the premise of the app had been communicated to the caf√©.

Update: having contacted the customer service directly - from the link they gave in their reply to my review - on 4th July, I‚Äôve still not received a reply. Pretty disappointing really. This app could be great, it‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt take customer views and responses seriously.",1,Apple,2019-07-22
"Amazing app I happened upon this app by chance - downloaded it and discovered tons of known food outlets in my area offering food at the end of the day at heavy discounts. So handy for someone  like me who lives alone and am often too tired after working long shifts in the hospital to prepare a fresh and nutritious meal. I am on a strict budget so I can‚Äôt afford to eat out or order takeaways very often.  
I collected my first order today and it was wonderful - healthy, tasty and plentiful. I am a firm convert now and am telling all my friends about it!",5,Apple,2019-05-16
"Good idea, just not much use around here This is a great concept and good app‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs very dependent on where you live how much use you can get from it. Locally we only have Morrison‚Äôs supermarkets when they do cheap fruit & veg packs - only rarely. Everything else is nowhere near here; a 50 plus mile journey to get some going cheap food isn‚Äôt going to get used. Also to the other reviewers moaning about old short dated or out of date food ‚Ä¶ uh, that‚Äôs the point !! Why are these people whining then giving 5 stars?! Anyway, best before dates are only guidelines for most foods - grow up and save the waste!",3,Apple,2021-12-15
"LOVE THIS APP This app is changing the game! So today I went to two bakeries. The first one brownie box Putney paid ¬£2.59 and received a large muffin and 4 brownies! Take into consideration a brownie is usually over ¬£2 I was very chuffed at the deal I got!! The second was Esquires coffee paid ¬£3.59. They are new to the app so when I walked in they let me choose whatever I wanted from a fab selection! Really and truly happy with this app! So grateful it‚Äôs in other countries too!

Thanks so so much for this app!",5,Apple,2019-04-13
Really good Customer Service I had recently used the app for the first time (which I found very intuitive and easy to use) BUT I wasn‚Äôt aware of how to update my dietary requirements when ordering a magic bag.

"First impressions New to this, so far so good. However initial fundamental problem, being disabled, my first mistake was to think I would be able to share the purchase info to my carers phone, but in the end I had to go along with difficulty.
Info needs to be shareable.

The food was lovely, no dried up leftovers. I would have had no problem paying full price for this had I gone into the pub to buy a meal.",5,Apple,2019-11-26
"Great app to save money and food A variety of shops have reduced the food by up to 66%.I have had three meals through this app so far, two of which have been fantastic value and one a disappointment. Overall, a great way to save money if you eat later in the evening. Some places have reductions earlier in the day. Remember these products have same day sell by dates. Some may be frozen.

With TooGoodToGo I pick up every day a generous box of cooked food or salads which I use on the day or next day.

"Wish there was more places that did this. Absolutely love this app, so simple to use. I just wish more places would do this as I have worked in a food place within a big company and it‚Äôs disgusting how much perfectly good food goes to waste. All it takes is one person to make an allegation whether it be false or true and it spoils it for everyone, especially when the food could be going to good causes.

I‚Äôve gone expecting vegetables and received a bag of wrinkly apples, soft plums and a rancid pineapple. I‚Äôve expected groceries and received 4 loaves of bread and a buffet load of processed meat. I‚Äôve even been given 10 fruit plastic snack bags with slices of apple and a couple of grapes in each one. Eventually, I realised that because the bags contained so much produce that I would or could never eat, I was paying to throw away food.

"Amazing! This app is amazing! Not only you get to save food that would otherwise be thrown away (which is terrible given how many resources go into producing it, and how many people are starving globally), but you get a good deal of food for the money. It‚Äôs a bit of a lottery in terms of what products you get, but I‚Äôve bought quite a few bags so far and I was always impressed with the quantity and quality of food. Plus, I discovered new places in my area that I‚Äôd never before thought of trying!",5,Apple,2019-07-15
"Brilliant Tried this app out for the first time yesterday and it works brilliantly. Would love if more vegan signed up, but would also be great if you could buy a vegan-specific magic bag from veggie and vegan-friendly places, as I found items aren‚Äôt necessarily labelled for ingredients/allergens. I know you can‚Äôt guarantee anything left over will be vegan but perhaps there‚Äôs some way to make this work? I think given how fast the vegan movement is growing it‚Äôs something more and more people will be looking for from the app. If there was this function I‚Äôd happily give it 5 stars.",4,Apple,2019-10-01
"Amazing I just want to applaud whoever created this. I‚Äôm amazed at the quantity of the food that I collected, and it was so fresh and delicious! I was a bit sceptical as I thought they may be giving out stale food or close to its end date etc, I was shocked at how fresh the food actually was! I would highly recommend, I‚Äôll definitely be using this more often! Such a fantastic way to reduce food waste which is just what this country needs! Honestly, well done! :)",5,Apple,2020-11-20
"Allergies‚Ä¶ Great app, and so far great food at a great price, although there should be an option for ticking off allergies. There‚Äôs severe nut and fish allergies in our household, and so far we‚Äôve been lucky not to receive any foods which contain these but should we receive foods contain nuts & fish, the whole box will have to be binned, wasting food someone else could‚Äôve had, and wasting our money. Please include an allergies tick box section (when registering?) so stores know not to include certain items for people who have allergies. Thanks!",4,Apple,2021-11-17
"Amazing Concept I hate seeing food going to waste. Whoever thought of this concept should be given a medal! Amazing idea and great to protect food being wasted when someone can get a generous bagful of food on the use by date, at a fraction of the price!

"Just okay It‚Äôs such a brilliant idea 
Morrison‚Äôs and other grocery stores the description says a mixture of items but on collection it‚Äôs a box of salad or a box of pears. Going off. So have to throw out. No point collecting something I am going to have to go home and throw away anyway.
Same as a local bakery I went to stale bread and items you couldn‚Äôt eat. 

They places are not doing what the description says. So either they change or the description should say you are collecting items that are not edible.",4,Apple,2021-01-31
"Some good items. But last bag was not good So need using this app for some time. Been getting loads of good things from fruit to chicken pies. 

But today‚Äôs bag had to be the worst. Had some food 4 months out of date. But it was all chocolate bars (Mars, twice etc). But 7 Mars bars and 5 twin is a bit unhealthy. 

So I am great full for the deals I have got. But I feel sometime some shops really could mix up what you get not just dump multiple items in a bag",5,Apple,2021-03-30
"Good idea. More Development I think the idea of the app its amazing, its something a lot of business has been doing for the last years. In my opinion there its room to improve, for example i really believe the up should have more pics about the food to be more specific what its on the deal and bring more  attention. In other side i will give more training or info in the locals who are participating  because its not the first time i try and they don‚Äôt know what should be on the deal. In other hand say thanks for the idea.",4,Apple,2018-12-11
"Only good experiences I‚Äôm a student and I use this app as much as I can because it‚Äôs one the best apps on my phone

The food that I collect is always so amazing, the prices are unbelievable but what really tops it is how proud food companies are that they are on the app and that you are saving good food. Every single establishment I‚Äôve been to has treated me with the same curtesy as a full paying customer and sometimes even better because you are reducing food waste

Couldn't recommend it more!!",5,Apple,2019-09-20
"A fabulous concept I have only just started using this app and so far I am very impressed so are my friends across different cities who can‚Äôt stop raving about it. 

I feel good about saving meals from being thrown out I‚Äôm getting far more exercise walking to different places around the city and I‚Äôm trying out so many different places I  maybe wouldn‚Äôt have tried otherwise. 

Definitely a great thing hope to see more places joining and help prevent food waste",5,Apple,2019-05-10
"Had always been a fan and always recommend the app I‚Äôve accidentally order the foods that is 20mins to end of collection time thinking it was for tomorrow as it was near the other restaurant‚Äôs vouchers for tomorrow. 

Cancelled it 10mins right before the collection time ended as I realized it‚Äôs for today. 

I feel like I was tricked by how the app is structured as the date to pick up the foods is too small at the bottom and it‚Äôs mixed up with collection for today or tomorrow which make customers confused. I customized which restaurants I like so it appears in just one line, hopefully it‚Äôs something to improve for the app.",2,Apple,2019-11-25
"Incredible value I‚Äôve used the app three times now with Morrison‚Äôs and the amount of stuff you receive in your Magic Box is absolutely incredible. 

There‚Äôs always loads of fruit and vegetables that are still in perfect condition as well as bakery products such as sliced bread and crumpets etc.

There‚Äôs normally so much stuff that we have to share it with friends and all for ¬£3.09.

Obviously some creative recipe planning skills can be useful when you receive your box but hey, that‚Äôs what Google‚Äôs for. 

I made a pot of pea shoot soup with baby onions, potatoes and carrots today, all from
the box, and the whole eight portions I got must have cost about 50p all in. My freezer is full to bursting. 

Definitely give Morrison‚Äôs a go if you have them in your area. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5,Apple,2021-01-09
"Useless for people who are health conscious or have allergies I was really excited when I found out about this app and immediately downloaded it. But after about ten minutes of browsing through the options available I had to admit that I was sorely disappointed. 

The options available consist almost entirely of highly processed junk food like cakes, biscuits, ready meals, fast food etc. People cannot live sustainably on this stuff no matter how much they prevent food waste by doing so. Furthermore, it‚Äôs just not good to encourage people to eat this stuff. 

Where healthy food can be obtained the user gets no control over contents. This is probably ok for people who have no allergies/intolerances, but what is the point for those of us who do? I‚Äôm trying to prevent food waste so why would I get food I can‚Äôt eat? 

I recognise that allergies must be a difficult issue for the app to deal with but nevertheless this is an issue for those of us with allergies. So if you have allergies, don‚Äôt bother!",1,Apple,2021-11-04
"Fantastic food! Unbelievable value! I used TooGoodToGo for the first time tonight and bought three carvery meals at Allerton Hall Farm for my family to try. The food is mouth-wateringly good! I can not believe how much there was as well! I will for sure be recommending both TooGoodToGo and Allerton Hall Farm to everyone! Thanks so much for a fabulous meal and an easy pleasant transaction that ended up costing me less than ¬£10 for all three hearty carvery meals complete with turkey, gammon, stuffing, roasties veg galore and lashings of thick delicious gravy! Even my chihuahua ate well tonight!",5,Apple,2019-10-28
"Good service... While away on holiday I purchased a magic bag of food from Warrens St Ives Cornwall , the young lady was so welcoming collection was easy and swift , I also spoke about other products that you sell at that store and returned to buy them over our holiday . I honestly cannot say enough good things about the store and the food in the magic bag . I would definitely return to this store  again and save more magic bags.   Thank you to good to go and THANK YOU WARRENS ST IVES CORNWALL üíê",5,Apple,2021-10-25
"Supermarket magic bag Morrison‚Äôs - You can only pick up from 9.15 pm at night and every single item of veg and soggy fruit is already at the sell by date so therefore you can‚Äôt do much with it.   I could not use up on the same day by the time I got home, made some soup with some at 10pm but felt really cheated.  No bakery products, meat or sweet treats that could be frozen. A waste of money and into my bin instead of the supermarkets.",5,Apple,2021-11-06
"Fab idea Absolutely fantastic way to reduce food waste. Meat still in date which can be made into something and frozen in the freezer or used the next day or just frozen for when required. Pastries can be frozen then slightly warmed up even sandwiches can be made into a toastie. Just spent over ¬£3 and got a family portion of 5% fat mince, two cod portions and 4 massive beef burgers. Very happy and will be clicking away to do it again...",5,Apple,2021-07-05
"Great app but can be improved I used this app once earlier in the year for my local Morrison‚Äôs.
I think I just got lucky because the contents was worth around ¬£30. Loads of tinned produce including lots of tuna, fresh bread, fresh fruit, fresh eggs, crisps, chocolates etc. It was amazing value for what it cost me. However the store has since stopped selling any. I wish more of my local stores were added like Greggs, M&S food hall and independent stores too. I‚Äôd be amazed if they don‚Äôt have any food waste!",4,Apple,2021-11-11
"Great idea, but 1 in 5 chances of disappointment Really a great idea of creating a win-win between shops and customers. However, I was denied any food or have had my ticket cancelled by the shop as I found when I got to the shop TWICE out of 10+ purchases which is really annoying. I know the bottom line is to rescue the leftover and not to commit to keeping the bargain, but there should be a function (text for instance) alerting this mis-match as soon as the shop is aware.",5,Apple,2019-02-22
"Great app for savings cash whilst doing good The app is very easy to use and has a good selection of places to choose from. You I‚Äôve only used it 3 times so far but have saved a lot and been impressed with how much was included. Doesn‚Äôt harm to also feel good about reducing waste. The only thing that may put people off is that it‚Äôs all a surprise, I see that as a plus but I‚Äôm not picky and don‚Äôt have any allergies.",5,Apple,2019-11-27
Fantastic Idea This is such a good idea and a great way to get a bargain. I ordered 3x breakfasts for our office and thought we would be given a pre filled box. Arrived and we were given boxes to fill ourselves from the buffet - decent sized boxes and very easy to use app. Paid via Apple Pay and get a notification to remind me of collection times. I like the option to filter the list by times available and also show only places still available that day.,5,Apple,2019-06-27
"My first ‚ÄúMagic Bag‚Äù I was told about this app from a friend.... too good to be true! 
NO!!! I bought a magic bag from Wenzel‚Äôs, went there for the allocated time and was shocked!! 
I even got to choose a fresh loaf! (Brown sourdough- my personal favourite) The lady filled up a carrier bag full of fresh produce and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get home and have a look. 
I had a fresh filled baguette, a fresh loaf, a steak patty and a steak slice, 2 fancy filled doughnuts and 2 fancy cupcakes! All that for just ¬£2.99!!!! 
I will be going back and trying other eateries. I‚Äôm in love with this app!! Happy customer!!",4,Apple,2019-06-30
"I‚Äôm shook! I just tried this today and I‚Äôm absolutely gobsmacked! I paid ¬£3.5 and in return got a bag full of lunch boxes each worth ¬£6 or so! Does depend on which restaurants are near you or are participating but so far I am in love. It was so much I had to share with my colleagues. I have encouraged them to download the app. You can also pay in the app directly, just show the receipt when you collect.  The app itself is extremely user-friendly! 10/10.",5,Apple,2019-07-18
"5 stars Very few apps have made any real impact on my life. And before anyone gets too excited about my review which is not about how the app works in terms of user friendliness, although it helps and this app is fine, all buttons in the place. The main reason for a 5 star rating is that I get to have Sushi, my favourite food, once a week, for ¬£3.50.  That‚Äôs it, and it‚Äôs all stuff that would have gone to waste, so I get to feel good about it too.  5 stars.",5,Apple,2018-07-24
"Absolute waste of time for me! So I joined this on the recommendation of work colleague, to date I have tried to order from Costa 3 times and 3 times my order had been cancelled 30 mins before due collection! My work colleague has had success with Carvery ordered but this is not what I want to order! Everyone  I have spoken to has had their Costa order cancelled? Pointless in my opinion I‚Äôm very disappointed.",5,Apple,2020-09-21
"Great concept, but needs a small tweak I love this concept and want to support the cause as much as possible. I would use this way more if I could specify some basic dietary preferences like ‚Äòvegetarian‚Äô, ‚Äòvegan‚Äô, or ‚Äònone‚Äô for each order. 
I can understand that this makes it harder for the restaurant but I do think you will have much higher uptake if you provide this option. 
Please consider adding this feature! It would make such a big difference! 
This is the reason I‚Äôve rated it 3 stars instead of 5.",3,Apple,2021-11-30
"Utterly brilliant! Saves you a fortune if you‚Äôre staying in a larger town - more rural areas have far less choice. I would give it 5 stars if the search options were better - for example, I would like to be able to just search within, say, 1km of me, rather than the minimum option of 3km. That‚Äôs a long way if you‚Äôre on foot! I‚Äôve had some really amazing bargains with this app, plus I‚Äôm buffing my halo on the green front. Thoroughly recommend.",4,Apple,2021-08-07
Charged for something I never collected Cancel option wasn‚Äôt made available on my order - messaged via the app about this but then later found I was charged for something I never even received!? So is this why companies use this platform - because I‚Äôve had some companies not cancel on their end when I arrive to find there‚Äôs no magic bag and they were out of stock - I literally had to demand for them to set the cancellation on their end to get my refund - which means this puts good willing customers in a situation where companies can claim the money even if the customer was never given any food. How awful!,1,Apple,2021-07-03
"Great idea! Needs some basic dietary reqs I really like this concept of reducing waste and mutually benefitting. It‚Äôs a good UI and layout, pleasing and easy to use. 

I would be able to use it more if there was some basic dietary options like vegetarian especially for the mainstream chains like costa etc it should be easy to do. The first time, I assumed that mostly the veggie options get left over but I guess the venue tried to balance it. The food looked lovely but it was a shame not for me. 
Bagel factory offered a specific veggie option, so I tried that and it was really good. 
The grocery one I tried was a bit disappointing as a lot of it was going off but there was some good veg and fruit. 

Basically because of the risk of getting non-veggie, and the limitations of staying local in lockdown, I don‚Äôt use the app anymore. 

Otherwise I‚Äôd highly recommend it for omnivores!",3,Apple,2021-01-19
"Wow it‚Äôs a win win Tried this app for the first time having downloaded for a while. My husband said not for us as we are not poor students! We collected 3 items of food from the cafe at the ashmolean museum at their closing time 4pm on a Sunday as we were there for an exhibition. A ham and cheese baguette, 3 halves of ciabatta sandwiches of aubergine and mozzarella cheese, and a flan with some salad! Not bad for ¬£3.59. So much food we gave some away to a homeless guy on the way home! 2 good deeds in a day! Thank you too good to go!",5,Apple,2019-10-06
"Questionable Signed up for this app a few weeks ago, and have yet been able to get a deal on anything. I know of people getting good deals in large towns and cities, but in the Torbay area of the UK, Too Good To Go is next to useless! Hopefully things may change in the future. There are several companies offering goods in this area, but every time I try to use them they go from ‚Äúreserve‚Äù to ‚Äúsold out‚Äù in the time it takes to refresh the screen. I can only assume this indicates the companies have nothing to offer....which follows for nearly all companies I look at.
To sum up....this may work great for you, but not for me in South Devon.",1,Apple,2020-02-26
"Love the concept I saw this app advertised on social media, loved the concept so checked out the app. I‚Äôve been able to quickly favourite places really close to me and others I would usually shop at anyway so I can see easily when there‚Äôs something relevant.
I‚Äôve had my first magic bag via the app and the reality exceeded my expectations. Will definitely be a regular user from now on.",5,Apple,2021-11-10
Delicious food and wonderful idea Parsons bakery offers the most wonderful tasty fresh food. The magic bag was full of delicious goodies. I was collecting mine as doorstop gifts for friends who were isolating. The food was lovely and varied which my friends were excited about and grateful for. A lovely surprise which I could not have afforded to do for them both otherwise. And to know that it helps to ensure food is used is icing on the top. Thank you!,5,Apple,2021-07-20
"Great initiative The first time we trying this abs must say Greggs lives up to it reputation of serving the community.
However, the Costa‚Äôs by Next in Lakeside has an awful Manager Yasmin who literally picked couple of cakes and sized us too to bottom almost turning us away until I showed her the Order. She then started picking and choosing and we got 3 items for 3¬£ 

Im sure this is not the case with other Costa‚Äôs this is a mean Manager here",5,Apple,2021-06-24
"Doe bakery After using the app once before and receiving 10 huge sausage rolls (no variety just far too many sausage rolls!) I had to bin half of them as we could never get through them I wasn‚Äôt keen to use the app again but got a bag from doe bakery today and the donuts were lovely, lots of variety and we will shop at this store more regularly as we hadn‚Äôt been there before  great find",5,Apple,2021-08-31
"Love this app the first time using this app, which is for buying left over food cheap from closing restaurants. Which we used to collect food from a local restaurant which gave us big portions of a biriyani which we took to give it to some homeless people so they have some hot food in there bellies. His will be a regular thing we do from now on what better way to not waste food then by giving them to people that need it more than others. Just wish there was more restaurants in my area that had this app.  Feeling good right now. #feedthehomeless #helping #dontwastefood",3,Apple,2018-06-06
"Rip off Had this app several years. I initially stopped using this app a few years back because restaurants would always a) cancel or b) be totally confused when I turned up to collect something.

I recently saw an ad which reminded me to use the app again. In the past month I have placed 7 orders. Out of those 7 orders I have only received food once! Restaurants repeatedly cancel, or change the terms of conditions after the sale (eg changing collection times to the evening instead of morning).

The app doesn‚Äôt provide a way to communicate with the people you‚Äôre ordering from, the address is wrong in several places (I went to the wrong address today, because I used the apps address) and there seems to be no rules in place to protect the customer - for example walking places and the restaurants refusing to serve or cancelling upon arrival.

Big waste of time and money.",2,Apple,2021-11-23
"Yum yumüòã Great app and so easy to use! Literally just a few clicks to place an order and then turn up at the specified time, show your receipt and collect the goodies. I've used this app a few times now and had been given generous portions each time. I'd like to think that I'm helping to save the planet, in a small way. If more and more people do this, then there will be a bigger impact. Food for thought! And thank you so much for developing this appüôèüèº!",5,Apple,2018-03-12
"Sometimes great. I‚Äôve had a few magic bags now and have had some great value ones and some not so good, it just depends what‚Äôs left over so can be hit and miss.   The most disappointing thing is sometimes your bag is cancelled when you are on your way to collect due to no surplus food left.  The best thing is the surprise in you don‚Äôt know what you will get, it has given me and the family new things to try and also has made me more creative with my cooking with using up different produce.",3,Apple,2021-08-22
"What a great idea! Heard about this app by chance through an article online, downloaded a day ago and today have used it for the first time. Really simple to use and a great idea! The times aren‚Äôt always convenient, but I happened to still be in central London after 7pm so thought I‚Äôd see if anything was available locally. I chose a magic bag from a Middle Eastern food place, the woman stuffed it to the top with rice, meat and various veg and sauces. Really good for only ¬£3.75. Hopefully more places will soon sign up for more variety.",4,Apple,2019-09-19
"Great concept, just a shame that it's not usable in my area. This is such a good idea, and is becoming more important as food waste increases. I downloaded and signed up to the app and everything looked great. The design is simple and very accessible. I'm visually impaired and use voice over, Apple's built in screen reader. Whether it was deliberate or not, you have created an app that is completely usable. The only downfall is that there are not any restaurants or shops that use this service in my area. I'm hoping this will change in the near future as I want to get started.",3,Apple,2019-04-09
"Shockingly good value, love it. 10/10 I got soo much at costa, I gave three wraps to a homeless person. I checked the dates good for two further days. This is such a magnanimous App I‚Äôm surprised nobody made an app sooner can only imagine the implications of complaints. Some stores such as M&S BP garage gave away old tosh like a Percy pig cake was gone off and Leicester cheese block was off the next morning. If this app stays as it is, I will always be a customer fosho",5,Apple,2021-06-09
Love using this app I have used this app a few times and I think it is such a great concept because you are spending a little bit of money for sometimes a bag full of yummy things. üòçAnd it stops restaurants and cafes from throwing this food in the bin at the end of the day. I have recommended to quite a few people too because not many people seem to know about it.,5,Apple,2020-02-08
"I am obsessed! This application is amazing! I have gotten amazing deals every time! Generous portions and good quality food. It‚Äôs also good for discovering new places.

Awesome! I love using this app to take me place to place around London trying all sorts of food for a very good price of course a lot of the rolls are going stale and the rice can be hard at places but that‚Äôs the nature of it and for ¬£3 with enough food for at least 2 people at most places I have no complaints plus I‚Äôve always wanted to ask for spare food at the end of the day at a lot of places now I know where to go and helping reduce waste can‚Äôt be bad,5,Apple,2019-10-29

"No information and buggy AF. Literally nowhere in the app itself did it obviously tell me how the process works.
I stupidly thought it was a deliveroo style service. So I placed an order then get told that I have to go collect it.

Try to cancel but only after placing the order does it tell you that it needs to be at least 3 hours(!) prior to collection if you want to cancel... mine was 2hrs50m away. Literally the only place where that information is available is through a link on the now un-cancellable receipt and the email receipt.

I try to contact them using the customer service form. But once you go into the form it‚Äôs impossible to navigate away from it afterwards or to tell if your complaint has been sent at all.

They‚Äôre all about stopping waste but they have no problem wasting my time and money. Also, the food I ordered is now going to be unclaimed and will as a result be thrown away... so that‚Äôs gone well! üëåüèº",2,Apple,2019-03-12
"Need more work shops profiting I tried at first - oh that is great! 
Later on,  canceled orders and still have to to come for collection, once missed collection have been charged for it anyway. But nothing in return when they failed prepare order for me.
Like for example Costa profiting by giving 3 toast for almost ¬£4. Some shops food was already not good for consuming smelly with foam etc:.
And you getting a lot of bread to eat lol.

"Packaging I love the magic bags but I‚Äôm disappointed in the amount of plastic packaging that is used. 
Last few times I‚Äôve collected my magic bags you can tell that they have decanted items into smaller plastic bags.

Good idea but awful execution Great idea in theory but after paying for my order I turned up at the restaurant with the staff having no idea what I was talking about. When I explained it to them there was no food available and I‚Äôd already clicked collect because the instructions weren‚Äôt clear and the app had told me the food was pending collection. So I‚Äôd paid already. No one to speak to about getting a refund and have to wait 3 business days for my query to be responded to.

"Try new things Whenever I know I‚Äôll be in a certain area ahead of time I like using this app to try new cafes/ restaurants and to get a surprise/ good deal. More places need to sign up to TGTG!

Super experience would recommend.",5,Apple,2021-03-02
Very useful app The app I find sometimes is a little clunky to navigate around if I‚Äôm not already in the area I‚Äôm going to want to buy from. I‚Äôve had three purchases one was ok and the two others were amazing value we even made up a bag of goodies for a young homeless man who our local friends had said was genuinely homeless.

"Greedy companies abusing this app Unfortunately, this app is not working well here in the U.K. The culture of goodwill doesn‚Äôt really seem to exist here. Most businesses are struggling, so maybe it‚Äôs because of that? But if that‚Äôs the case, they shouldn‚Äôt be bagging up their mouldy fruit and low value items to sell as a mystery bag for more than they‚Äôd charge for it at normal price. It begins to verge on being a scam. 

You won‚Äôt get food that is ‚Äòtoo good to go‚Äô, you will get what was already un-saleable even at a discount, and that would already be in the bin, and low value items that would be cheaper to buy in the shop itself.",1,Apple,2021-08-20

"Great app for a great cause Love this app! Simple UI and amazing to see so many partnerships with cafes, restaurants and supermarkets already. 

The missing one star is purely for the developers to read my review and fix the ‚Äúreciept / claiming magic bag‚Äù part of the process as it‚Äôs not clear what the buyer needs to do when the go collect. I thought I needed to swipe as it says ‚Äúswipe to collect‚Äù but that invalidated my reciept on collection.

Update: I gave it another shot- this time I got an extra sandwich which I couldn‚Äôt even eat.

Update 2: Third time lucky! I was determined to make this work. The cafe was a lot more generous, but it still doesn‚Äôt make up for the first two. All the same chain, so not sure why there is such a discrepancy. If I am to use this app in the future, I think I will have to play it safe and return to this location.",2,Apple,2018-11-07
"Disappointing I just used this app for the first time, having downloaded it a while ago. The timings were good to order a bag from M&S and pick it up on my way home from work. I was curious to see what was inside when I got home. There were four items, 6 chicken thighs, garlic bread, 3 chicken tenders and 2 cream doughnuts. All had already been reduced to sell as they went out of date today, so this total was just over ¬£7 for the lot - not the ¬£12 advertised value. Found it all a bit of a dispiriting experience, not one to repeated.",2,Apple,2021-11-20
Magic Bag from Morrisons. After trying to order one of these magic bags for several weeks. We were finally lucky enough to get one. We were pleasantly surprised. There was a good variety of fruit and veg in it so for us was perfect as we are on a healthy eating plan at min. The fruit and veg was of a good quality and fresh  other than one bad tangerine ( in a bag of at least ten) so would definitely order one of these again,4,Apple,2021-03-15
"Morrisons Magic Bag After trying a couple of times at my local Morrisons to get one of these (reserved and then order cancelled by the store) I widened my search field. I chose a larger store and I was not disappointed on collection. Loads of still fresh fruit and veg, bread and cakes!! The total cost in store would have been ¬£20, so my extra travel to the store was well worth the ¬£3 I paid!!",5,Apple,2020-10-04
"Great idea Great idea to have an opportunity to reduce food waste and have some tasty meals for attractive prices at the same time.
But you need to watch for it rather frequently so you do not miss the relatively narrow window, at different times throughout a day, to book your magic bag in limited available supply... I guess it is a part of the game.
I would recommend it. Give it a go.",5,Apple,2020-09-27
"Fab idea Such a great idea for reducing the amount of food that‚Äôs thrown away and giving a cheaper option for people to get a cheaper alternative to takeaway food. Really easy and straightforward app to use as well. 
However, it would be great if you could specify that you‚Äôre vegetarian when ordering as I wouldn‚Äôt order from a sandwich shop in case they gave you a meat one.",5,Apple,2019-11-28
"It‚Äôs idealistic, not realistic The Idea is good, but I guess the society just doesn‚Äôt like the idea of eating the leftovers, Apparently this even includes your clients which are the restaurant owners. They don‚Äôt have any authority to tell if they have any food left, which is very dangerous for your business. Also I‚Äôve been told to get the leftovers (yes I am doing exactly that), and I feel ashamed, why? Because it‚Äôs shameful to hear, only poor people deserve that I guess. I don‚Äôt know what to say. The whole experience won‚Äôt let me use your app anymore, wish all the best.",2,Apple,2020-08-10
"Excellent idea, well executed What a great business, on so many levels. 

Food miles are inevitably travelled for a food outlet to make its own goods. And we all know that businesses pay for waste removal.

So what better way to prevent wasted food miles, plus staff time and space in landfill, than for customers to receive this at a heavily discounted rate. A little more ¬£ in the coffers for the business - and it gave us the opportunity to sample Wenzel‚Äôs first rate food, which in turn led to us buying from them again. 

Had only one issue, when collection time was stated as 4.50pm and the store closed at 4.30pm (Sunday), leading to a wasted trip. The refund appeared next day, excellent customer service.",5,Apple,2020-06-20
"Stores can be a total joke I‚Äôve had this app for a while and nothing has ever popped up nearby. Twice in the past 14 days I‚Äôve ordered with a local bakery, and twice they‚Äôve cancelled the order.

I know it‚Äôs leftover food, however it seems to me, that if customers have to cancel two hours prior to the time window, the store shouldn‚Äôt be able to cancel your collection ten minutes before the window?

It‚Äôs a great idea, but the stores seem to treat it like everyone is next door and has nothing else to do all day. (The first order was cancelled instantly, the second first had the time changed, then was cancelled at 15:20, for a 15:30 collection, when I was obviously already on my way!)

There needs to be some kind of system where stores can‚Äôt just make a joke of the app and customers, as much as I want to try with another store, my experience so far really puts me off trying again.",1,Apple,2021-09-13
Not for Veg*ns Disappointed to see that despite living in an area with loads of places signed up there are only a couple of vegetarian options and no vegan options at all. Sadder still is I am sure some of the regular places have veg*n stuff to get rid of but we will never know.  I see no reason why they couldn‚Äôt offer veg magic boxes and regular magic boxes. This seems a massive oversight on the part of too good to go as there is a big crossover between veg*ns and people who really care about food waste. This app is basically useless without a massive overhaul.,2,Apple,2020-02-09
"Fundamentally badly designed The workflow of: order on iPad and pick up on iPhone is impossible since logging in on one device seems to log out all other devices. What a pain- having to repeatedly log in on different devices.

Update: Firstly, one star was to get attention. I think the app is fundamentally ok so have updated this. Secondly, the workflow I suggest is not ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù but is painful. Thirdly, thanks for the developer response but I have no more information to give- could you reproduce the problem as described?",3,Apple,2018-08-01
Great idea but app is a bit clunky Great idea to have restaurants etc give away some food that will get thrown out for a small price. The app is hard to use though and it doesn‚Äôt make it easy to find stuff. Often the businesses are not aware that you are coming and generally look pretty unhappy to see you. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because the app takes too much of a percentage. There‚Äôs no way of knowing as you pay through the app.,3,Apple,2021-06-07
"Transcendant I have thought about using this app several times, this week I finally took the plunge and let me tell you; I am not disappointed each bag has had such good variety and me and my partner have opposite tastes yet have both enjoyed the items in every bag. I am so pleased and excited about this discovery. This app is in fact ‚Äútoo good to go‚Äù.",5,Apple,2021-04-10
"Takes your money then have to wait for refund when order cancelled by establishment What‚Äôs not exactly helpful when you are on your absolute a*se and trying to economise on food is when you place an order through this app, only to have it cancelled by the retailer as they would have no leftovers around an hour later. Which I understand happens, but given that my refund is now going to take 7 days to be returned to my card and I now have even less money with which to stave off the old hunger... aye, not ideal!",2,Apple,2020-03-09
"Useless to me Think this app is such a good idea, however with the leftover ‚Äòmagic‚Äô bags, there‚Äôs no way to define dietary requirements e.g. vegetarian or vegan (understandable that allergies would probably not be possible as that‚Äôs more complicated). 
However as most places now offer vegan options there should be a way for them to list vegan bags or non-vegan/mixed bags so we know whether we can pick them up or not. Unsure is this is down to app design or the retailers themselves but either way, it‚Äôs pointless downloading unless you eat meat unfortunately.",2,Apple,2021-10-28
"Amazing app! Absolutely love this app i use it so often it‚Äôs one of the greatest apps I have
The customer support is absolutely amazing any issues I‚Äôve had have been resolved within hours and I‚Äôve been able to eat amazing quality food at a fraction of the price! 
Love knowing how much CO2 has been stopped from going to landfill!
Told all my mates about it we often fight over who gets what",5,Apple,2018-12-08
"Such an amazing company! Honestly I am so happy a company like this exists! I work in a food restaurant and the amount of stuff we throw away is terrible! It‚Äôs good companies are being encouraged to put unsold food to use! I hope many more companies parter with toogood2go in future! 

Also such an easy process! Took no more than 2 minutes! Extremely happy !",5,Apple,2021-09-06
"Must get app Purchased 1 M&S bag for ¬£4 got a chicken to pop in the freezer ¬£6, chicken and leak pie, selection of veg that will last a good few days and a loaf of bread that we‚Äôve all just had tea and toast with. This was my first purchase using the app after 5 mins of downloading. We need more supermarkets to do this instead of throwing hundreds of pounds of good quality food away. üòä",5,Apple,2021-03-17
üòç Best app ever invented. As a lover of food it doesn‚Äôt get much better than this. Tried for the first time this morning. Purchased one breakfast as there was only one left. Got to the hotel at the allotted time wishing I had brought two. They gave us a takeaway box and said help your self. I couldn‚Äôt believe it!! ¬£1.25 each for an all you can eat breakfast still full up now. Will be using this app a lot!,5,Apple,2019-04-07
"Great! But be careful Really great concept, so much food goes to waste and this is a way for businesses to make last minute cash while making more happy customers. 

Only issue is that some places use this as a way to rip people off, charging you for more than it‚Äôs worth.

Great app but make sure you go to the places with good star ratings, avoid wasting your time and money on those without.",4,Apple,2020-11-03
"Great app - some teething problems I‚Äôve only used the app a couple of times and while I think it‚Äôs a brilliant idea and will continue to use, the shops haven‚Äôt ever received the correct information regarding my order. The first time they hadn‚Äôt received my order at all and the second they only received one out of two of my orders but hopefully it‚Äôs just my experience and not everyone‚Äôs",4,Apple,2020-11-13
"Not getting your monies worth There must be a catch with this app that there so many people using because I have used it twice today when is the first time actually I am using this app and I can tell you for a fact that I did not get my monies worth.
First attempt I got two expired jars of jam for ¬£4! 4¬£... I could go to Waitrose and pick two of my favourite jars for 4¬£!!

Second I got two pastries and a yogurt for 3.25¬£.... last time I checked a pastry was ¬£1 at your local supermarket and a yogurt was max 1.20¬£, so I actually ended up paying more than what I would have normally.

If this is an app that helps the business sell its leftover food for a fraction of the price instead of throwing it away I would expect that ‚ÄòMagic Bag‚Äô to be relatively much bigger or less pricey to make up for the fact that they would have thrown it away at a loss anyway and you the customer I paying for something that is not premium quality.

Disappointed...",1,Apple,2019-08-08
"Love the idea The idea behind this app is brilliant, who wants good food to go to waste? And there‚Äôs so much choice on here. However I wish more restaurants would stand by the app. The amount of times I‚Äôve gone to the food establishment (a few minutes into the time window) and they‚Äôve ‚Äúrun out‚Äù aka they‚Äôve already thrown away everything is disappointing. Especially when you rely on it for a late after work dinner. 
I‚Äôve had some great bargains from it, just feel a bit disheartened at the moment!",3,Apple,2019-01-19
"Idea is good The app idea is good, yet our first Nisa experience we were impressed with a big WOW than everything went downhill. We tied M&S, Pret, local Pastry shop and the food we got not worth what we paid for. Many reduced to 20p so if we bought it ourselves we at least could pick what we can eat not all the junks that will move from the shop bin t ours. This will put off others in using the app again. It is a shame as the idea is great. May be the app owner could set the bar to the shop so they can‚Äôt put us off.",2,Apple,2021-07-07
"Sold out before it‚Äôs available or refunded We‚Äôve only been successful twice with securing bags as Morrison‚Äôs bags are sold out the second they are released or if you are lucky enough to secure one, it‚Äôs subsequently refunded as not available.

Good app but But i always tend not see when items are placed available and i see some items always out of stock and doesnt restock.

"A Magical Surprise Out of the blue the Coop sent me a link to the App and being a nosey so and so, I had to try it out.  The nearest Magic Bag was at a Waitrose based store at a Shell service station. Easy to order and easy to collect using the App - and boy what a collection - two salads, fruit and three mains which I froze. Excellent value and only ¬£5. Plus I was helping to reduce wasted food.",5,Apple,2021-10-08
"Highly Recommended! If you are reading reviews and you come across this, I am telling you that you should definitely use this app. This 100% tackles food waste and you always get loads of food for barely any money!

"If only there was more‚Ä¶ If i‚Äôm to say one thing, GET THIS APP! :)

It defeats the purpose of this app - but for once, i WISH there was more food waste. This app always has variety and has me hooked. It‚Äôs always a surprise and that‚Äôs half the fun. I don‚Äôt feel bad buying food too. 

The only thing I would change - more places should get onboard. The Netherlands is packed, bits of the UK, not so much. I wish more places to join.",4,Apple,2021-09-05
"I wish you could give more details reviews Reviews only shows the star rating but not the details for each restaraunt , it would be nice to be able to give extra details like ‚Äú20minute wait for collection but nice restaurant to wait in‚Äù or ‚Äúfood given in paper bag that broke almost immediately, bring you own bag‚Äù these type of things are good to know in advance.",4,Apple,2021-09-05
"Love this app The idea is fantastic.  Some of the food places don‚Äôt always follow what this is about and just sell 5 cheap portions a day, but I still win.  I had a particularly bad experience when handed frozen blocks of food, but one email and I was fully refunded as this clearly isn‚Äôt the agreement.  I‚Äôve had lots of great, cheap food which has been great since moving to London and living on a tight budget!",5,Apple,2018-08-06
"App crashes and can‚Äôt add payment - a great store but can‚Äôt shop! Food options still growing in my region but still good. Unfortunately the app crashes when I go to add a payment method or go to buy a bag. 

Downloaded and reloaded. V frustrating.

Will try again in a year when the glitches have been ironed out

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Update:

Left the app open and tried multiple times a day to use it and could not get to payment options. Ensured I had the latests updates etc.

Then...

Spontaneously it started working!

Within a week of leaving my original review the app makers also responded personally with some advice and info of how to access their customer service - that‚Äôs rare in my experience!

Looking forward to picking up a magic bag soon.

Glad I kept trying! This coincided with an update on the app shop saying they‚Äôd been working to iron out glitches - worked for me!",2,Apple,2019-07-03
"Haven‚Äôt got any food 3 times over First time I used it I turned up to find the restaurant in question completely closed. Couldn‚Äôt get anything from them. Spoke to 2 friends where exactly the same happened, they have both deleted the app since. One of the friends also said when they did get food it‚Äôs just sides or something like a few potatoes - wouldn‚Äôt even pay ¬£3.50 for that. Got refunded but that doesn‚Äôt really change anything for me - I have lost trust because it was a waste of time and travel and probably won‚Äôt try again.  Sad because I was excited and it seemed a great idea.",1,Apple,2019-06-03
"Brilliant idea to avoid food waste This app is good. First time using and more than worth it. Even the pre packed food were close to used by date but it is still good for freezing.

Highly recommended üëç",5,Apple,2021-12-25
"Bear My sister told me of this app, so we ordered a Co op magic bag that night and couldn‚Äôt believe what we got in the bag, great variety and tasty food.

"Great concept but app could be more user-friendly Love this idea and have enjoyed all the food I‚Äôve saved (also love the surprise element) but it would benefit from an option to share collection information so someone else in your household could collect on your behalf.

"Fabulous idea Tried this for the first time yesterday and was so impressed. Great value, good variety & quantity of food, local store and so quick & easy to do. 

I will definitely be doing this on a regular basis. I hate waste & love a bargain, so it ticks all the boxes for me. Everyone should do it and more stores/restaurants should participate if they don‚Äôt already recycle leftover food in some way. Can‚Äôt praise this concept enough.",4,Apple,2020-10-05
Suzywuzy50 I thought you got a lot a great nice food for the prices. And would definitely recommend to friends & family. It‚Äôs better to use this than it going waste.

"Morrisons - Five Lane Ends, Bradford Great selection of food, lots of variety. Really like the concept. 

However we did receive all our items already 1 day out of date (collected on 29th and the items all had 28th on) and we did receive some mouldy oranges which were obviously not edible and should not have been included.",5,Apple,2021-04-30
"Amazing Concept Can‚Äôt rate this app highly enough. I love the whole concept of reducing food waste. As a gastropub owner, I‚Äôve been able to avoid our leftover produce going in the bin whilst making a couple of bob on it. As a user, I‚Äôve been give. The opportunity to try places I would probably never visit but now would definitely return and pay full price. Win/win all round.",5,Apple,2019-07-28

Dissapointing The concept is great but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work out. I‚Äôve had two very disappointing experiences where the place I‚Äôve ordered from either had no food left or were closed. I got a refund but it didn‚Äôt make up for the time or travel to these places. Furthermore I noticed that the same place that I was closed when I arrived was advertised the next week at the same time despite me now knowing that it will actually be closed during that time.

The value of what you get from business just depends on the business. I‚Äôve had a nice breakfast this morning from a nice hotel( Meicure Hotel-London Bridge thank you- a lovely french lady invited in and ordered my breakfast for me)  and a panini for lunch today from Costa.

It‚Äôs better to use the higher end stores but I guess this depends on where you live and there are some stores I really wouldn‚Äôt use it for because of the quality of the food and how they store the food. 

I‚Äôve used it for groceries and restaurants and only really had one not so good experience in which they were happy to refund me. The service is excellent 

I use it for groceries once a week (¬£4 a week) then I Just do a little topup shop for things I need.

"Don‚Äôt bother stores just cancel your order We starting using this app as more coffee shops were offering the service, the way food is reserved needs to change as this app has one critical flaw, you reserve the food the day before then the store are able to cancel your order at anytime if they don‚Äôt have the food, even if it‚Äôs an hour before collection as happened today when we went to Caff√® Nero the algorithm process needs to change, why not reserve the food for people when the shop knows they have it left!?",1,Apple,2021-02-20

I purchased 2 x breakfasts and the food boxes were full to the brim with bacon, eggs, hash browns ect. I will definitely be using again.",5,Apple,2019-05-03
"Good concept, but bad idea. I made a purchase near my house, paid ¬£2.5 for a supposedly ¬£6-7 ""magic bag"" with a secret meal. Went there at the time written in the app, but they were still working. I asked if I should be back later, but they said no. For the first time in my life I felt like I was begging for a favour, begging for good. They gave me a pity plain croissant and two more small bread things, of all the tasty thing they had in the shop on display, right in front of me. I returned them whatever they handed me and walked away feeling like a beggar. 

I was excited to have this food, because I was hungry and waiting to get it for few hours.

Whatever idea this app has, it can't force the shop to act well. The whole idea is based on kindness of people running their food businesses, which is a toss in my experience.

I came in excited, walked away feeling as a beggar.",1,Apple,2019-12-07
"Best find this year Just got this and I love it. There‚Äôs so much choice even near me, some corner stores, bakeries, butchers, pubs, cafes and even a fudge shop. Of course it‚Äôs a lucky dip what you get, and reduced stuff is reduced for a reason, but if you‚Äôre not picky and on a budget this app could be your best friend. Picking up my ¬£30-worth of fudge for a tenner this afternoon ;)",5,Apple,2021-08-11
"Winner for my dinner! Downloaded app and browsed meals few times before choosing. App easy to use but you have to be quick to reserve meals as not everything on offer is for your taste. Upon arrival, staff knew about the scheme, gave me good choice of food, and showed me how to collect in app. Really pleased with my huge Salmon Udon soup for ¬£2.50. Winner for my dinner ü§©",5,Apple,2021-06-09
"Great initiative I‚Äôve had the app a while but unfortunately I do not have many close facilities 
There is a Morrison's box but it‚Äôs sold in the blink of an eye 

I did regretfully order a fried chicken meal which ended up being worth less than the ¬£3 I paid (nevermind the ¬£10 supposed value). I contacted the app and they refunded the money",5,Apple,2020-11-18
"Anson farm Fantastic, was expecting the magic box to be filled with whatever was available, wasn‚Äôt expecting to be sent to see the carver, given a choice of meats and then being directed to the vegetables with a massive takeaway box, what a brilliant idea, the food was hot by the time we got home and the gravy was served separately in a polystyrene cup and all for ¬£3.29 thank you for a fab post Xmas meal",5,Apple,2019-12-27
"Good app, great idea, BUT... ... seriously undermined by some of the restaurants and cafes participating. 

At least 50% of the places I have bought from give half portions to match the half prices. So effectively, whilst they may be saving food waste, I am not saving any money. Add that to the fact that I can‚Äôt pick what I want, this app feels kinda pointless. The restaurant wins, but I don‚Äôt. I may as well buy the full plate I want.

(I have only used places I am already a customer of, so know regular portion sizes and price.)",2,Apple,2020-03-04
Really helpful As a jobbing actress it is a challenge to feed yourself economically and healthily when working away from home. Good to Go offers variety at a good price. If you read the descriptions carefully and accept that some portions will be heavier on carbs than others you can pick up some great food. Portions have been generous.,5,Apple,2019-12-17
"Amazing full box of goodies The box was filled to the brim with an assortment of items. Bread, waffles, various fresh fruit & veg along with hot cross buns. 
I was very happy with what I paid for the magic box, along with all the items that were included, I would definitely buy another & also recommend it to others.",5,Apple,2020-02-28
"Good idea It‚Äôs a good app. Easy to use. However to improve it, they should have notifications when a place put boxes on sales. As different place put boxes on sales at different time each day. It would encourage people to buy and not miss out. May be just notifications from the list of favourites? So we are not bombarded with notifications.",4,Apple,2019-11-19
"Great selection Initially when I arrived at the boulangerie it took some time for the staff to get off their phone in a phone call. That aside, he had good customer service (not being rude and being polite instead) and ensured my magic bag had a good range of options (from pasta, to dessert and pastries!)

Overall pleased with the selection of items provided and quantity!",4,Apple,2021-07-17
"It‚Äôs a great idea in theory I am REALLY onboard with this idea, anything that stops food waste is fine by me. 

My transaction was great, easy to use, fast and the store didn‚Äôt ask me questions or look blankly at me when I turned up

BUT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Don‚Äôt expect to get anything other than a cost cutter deal or anything like that here. 

If you‚Äôre signing up for something other than supermarket foodstuffs don‚Äôt bother. 

The ‚Äúfresh‚Äù stores on here sell out at weird and wonderful times with NO HOPE of you knowing when it may be. 

For instance Greggs sells out the tuesday‚Äôs items on Monday at 19:30 so I think I know I‚Äôll log on on Tuesday for Wednesday at 19:30, the app just stays on sold out today at 19:30 no matter what it‚Äôs frustrating beyond belief",3,Apple,2021-06-11
"Infinity pizza Sunderland I picked up my box today. This was my first time using g thy his app. 

The guy was so lovely and I got to pick what I wanted from the buffet and salad bar. 
I probably could have got a bit more but as it was my first time I was a bit unsure about what to do and didn‚Äôt want to do anything wrong by getting too much.",5,Apple,2020-01-29
Local bargains to be found at your fingertips What a great way to budget and eat the best prepared food. Living in Kent and working in SE London I‚Äôm fortunate to be able to access great food both at home and at work. The new software update brings new categories and sub sections making it easy to find what‚Äôs local to you and you can even plan your meals in advance.,5,Apple,2019-04-04
"Feels like a big sales tactic Yeah it‚Äôs all good and well saving the planet and not having waste. However when the woman came to the store to to tell us about the app she talks about how great it is to save waste. Yeah we agree. However what followed was immediate sign up and having to agree to have a set amount of waste a day before even half the day is over. 

The good rating is from the customers. I can see it working for some places wanting to sell some food rather than carry it over. 

I think it‚Äôs just a big corporate scam dressed as good.",1,Apple,2019-11-26
"Terrible customer service. Avoid The shop I went to had screwed up and gave me a cr*p selection not worth the money. However it‚Äôs how TGTG have dealt with it that really annoys me. Especially given it was my first time using this service. No reply to my complaint. No apology. Simply credited my account. Given I won‚Äôt likely use the app after this terrible experience this is useless. I emailed asking for a refund to my payment method. Ignored. They‚Äôve obviously taking a cut of what customers pay, so they need to up the customer service. And stop others from suffering same issue I did.",1,Apple,2019-09-15
"First collection Found the system of selection, ordering, payment very easy , like the details of how far away the collection point is , so you are able to determine if you walk, cycling, or car to decide on purchasing 
Very well thought out app.",5,Apple,2021-09-13
"Great but could do with a veggie option Good app, great value and encouraging ethos. First time we have used the service and overall it was great. However, we are vegetarian and 3/4 of the contents of the bag contained meat. I hope further down the line that there can be an option for vegetarians (and other dietary requirements) built in.",5,Apple,2020-11-10
Great concept This is a great app with a fabulous concept. The only thing I think would improve it is being able to get a notification when a certain store has bags available. I never seem to be able to get bags from the store I like because they become available at random times in the day,4,Apple,2021-04-21
Impressed This was the first time I used the app and had no idea what to expect. I have to say I was very impressed. When I arrived at the pub I was told where to go. I went over to the carvery counter and chose what I wanted. My other half was very happy with his tea as was I. Definitely will be using this app again soon.,5,Apple,2020-07-29
"Great idea but app needs improvement I love this, it helps to fight the food waste and you can buy great food for unbeatably low price. Ideal for take away dinner after work. However their app needs improvement. The most important feature is missing - showing the nearby restaurants with available meals to pick up right now.",5,Apple,2018-08-10
Great app and concept ! I took the plunge and did my first transaction last week on the proviso I would have it refunded since I received an email from developer offering me it. I finally got my refund today as it seems there was a ticketing issue. Pleased with the choice of merchants in my area. I will give it a few more goes but it‚Äôs a brilliant concept.,5,Apple,2018-08-04
"Costa belper magic bag This was my first magic bag and I couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled! The staff were super friendly and helpful, they showed me how to use the app to collect and delivered it to me swiftly. The food was a great mix of savoury and sweet and packaged so carefully I feel as though I‚Äôve had a real treat today, Thankyou Belper Costa coffee I‚Äôll be back again.",5,Apple,2021-11-24
Brilliant Was disappointed with my first choice of store but since then I have been absolutely delighted with the products I received for such a low price. Now I‚Äôm used to being quick of the mark I am regularly using this app and I‚Äôm extremely impressed with it.,5,Apple,2021-11-01
"Hotel breakfasts Edinburgh Ibis & Novotel done. Recommend arriving at the start of the time period. You arrive at the end of their hotel buffet breakfast, fill your box and go. Ibis even gave me wooden cutlery, coffee and a porridge pot in Vegware but a polystyrene box. Reused the box at Novotel (they offered a slightly smaller cardboard box): higher quality breakfast but no coffee/pot. Brilliant value and less food binned.",5,Apple,2019-12-29
"Nice idea, poorly executed. I‚Äôve used the app a few times now and one thing has become very clear, it‚Äôs less about food waste and more about a cheeky profit on the side. 

Staff are rarely aware of the app when collecting and the makers manipulate the amount of tickets left per restaurant. Today I collected an order from a local cafe only to be told they had not had an order through the app since March (despite the ‚Äòonly one left‚Äô post listed on the app).

I won‚Äôt be using the app again and would recommend avoiding.",1,Apple,2020-08-15
"1st time user of magic bags Just heard about this app today and so gave it a go straight away. Easy to use app, fantastic concept, great food, well worth the money and enough to feed my family of 3 for 3 days (use by today but freezable)Very happy and will recommend to everyone I know üòä",5,Apple,2021-11-10
"Very Disappointing I was really looking forward to using this app. However, my first use was today and I went to Yo Sushi at 3pm as told. I was then informed after a 10 minute wait that there was no wasted food, and therefore left with nothing. The manager was rude and seemed to think I didn‚Äôt understand the concept of wastage.
My issue is that Yo Sushi must know roughly when there will be wastage each day. Why tell me to come between 3.00 and 3.30 and give me nothing? I would have happily gone later.
I have wasted my time and money for car parking.
I will not use this app again.",1,Apple,2019-05-15
"Out of Date Food Excellent idea if only some of the shops didn‚Äôt use it as an excuse to clear out their out of date food! My first bag was full of food that I will never use and it had biscuits dated end of February 2021, it‚Äôs now July. Other foods are dated end of April 2021. Why are these items still in stock?",5,Apple,2021-07-11
"Great idea, standard of food varies. I love the idea of minimising food going to waste so I think Too Good To Go is great.  I have visited lots of different outlets in London.  I find the food you get even, from the same place, can vary a lot but I love the idea of the Magic bag being a surprise. Payment has always been easy too.",5,Apple,2021-02-22
"Wearside farm This was my first time and we were absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of food and how amazing it tasted, I think this will definitely be a regular thing especially when my arthritis is acting up and it becomes difficult for me to cook, 5 stars all the way and thank you so much üòÅ",5,Apple,2019-12-29
Downloaded this today and it is great! I downloaded this today and it is incredible! I have already used it In two separate locations and I love it. The restaurants are great and the food you get it‚Äôs always fresh and sometimes still warm. I will use this regularly and will share it with all my friends and colleagues.,5,Apple,2019-10-27
"So easy to use! After waking up feeling super ill, I used TooGoodToGo for a cheap breakfast and it was perfect! Stopped by the hotel I booked through on the app, and they took less than 2 minutes to bring me my breakfast bundle. 2,50‚Ç¨ and I got 4 croissants and a pain au chocolat. Highly recommended! Cheap, quick, and you know you‚Äôre helping limit food waste!",5,Apple,2019-09-24
"What a wonderful app! TooGoodToGo has become something I really depend on and use regularly - as a student, I appreciate the affordable prices - the all allows me to buy good quality food that would otherwise be beyond my budget. It‚Äôs a win-win, because this food would otherwise be going to waste! Can‚Äôt recommend enough :)",5,Apple,2019-03-16
Really great idea Love this app have used twice now for collection. I have a great variety and number of stores near by which part take. Very simple to use and for the amount of food you get/retail value of food you got for as little as ¬£2 is amazing! Highly recommend,5,Apple,2021-03-29
World‚Äôs best app - making it easy to get great food and do a little something for the planet I collected the most amazing arancini and salad from a little deli South London last night. Incredible so much food gets thrown away. Every time I check the app more stores are added - I‚Äôm using this app every week.,5,Apple,2019-12-03
"Disappointed I really wanted this to work ss a concept so me and my family could make a small difference to the food waste problem. I‚Äôve yet to get a box. No matter what time of day or day of the week I try for, I even changed my location to try and hit another town but nothing is ever available, it‚Äôs all sold out. I guess the creators of the app will be happy to hear this as it‚Äôs obviously making a difference and is very popular in West Yorkshire, but as a user it‚Äôs frustratingly disappointing.",1,Apple,2020-09-13
"Amazing - yo sushi This is my first time I have written an App Store review but I have to say this app is amazing I love the fact that there is something out there stopping the waste from these major chains, we have had food for yo sushi and for ¬£3 we have had our choice of so much food - really impressed will keep on using and recommended to many friends",5,Apple,2019-09-11
"Ideal for student or not To good to go offers me the opportunity to save at least ¬£50 per week. Sadly no butcher yet, hopefully on will be a food saver and allow us to buy.

Honestly if I really wanted to be picky, I would say please force people to take their glass or bee wraps to get the food. 
I am looking forward to see more shops to take part to this adventure!",5,Apple,2019-07-23
"Absolute rubbish I placed to orders. The first one I got an email 2 minutes before collection time to say the order was cancelled. 
The second one I drive to the Soar to pick up and was advised by the staff that I needed to swipe the app to say confirm collection. After doing that that another member of staff came from the back of the store and said it should have been cancelled in the afternoon. As I had swiped to confirm collection I was charged and sent an invoice but I got nothing. I sent a message to the help centre who have still not replied.",1,Apple,2021-10-20
"Fantastic idea! What a great app, was so easy to use, I was worried when collecting my order I would have to explain the app but they knew straight away what it was, fantastic idea at reducing food waste! Be prepared for surprise on what you get, but at such a reduced price you can‚Äôt complain.  Really recommend!!",5,Apple,2020-10-10
"Excellent hot and tasty, very generous portion Picked up a beautifully presented, piping hot carvery roast dinner. Staff who attended to me was patient and demonstrated fantastic customer service ( was my first time doing this) meal was massive, a bit of everything, such a large meal, could have shared it and still been full üòä delicious and will definitely do this again!",5,Apple,2020-10-09
"Great app, wonderful Suppliers Used to use this for my favourite Juice Bar in Milton Keynes, but now have realised the many options available around me in Leicestershire! App is slick to use, quick to use and pay with, suppliers so far have all offered amazing value. I‚Äôve recommended this to many people",5,Apple,2020-08-31
"A great service for a great cause I love this app because not only do you get delicious fresh food from local restaurants, cafes and hotels, but you can get whole meals (even more than one!) at considerably lower prices than through other means, all while saving the planet and reducing food waste just a little bit. I‚Äôm proud to use this!",5,Apple,2019-10-20
"Never able to buy anything I set up notifications for my local Morrisons as I didn‚Äôt really have any other options for where I live. However, in the 2 weeks of having the app, I was never able to get a box even though I had set up notifications and always checked within the stated timeframe. The boxes constantly showed as sold out but would update later in the evening stating that the time they sold out was after the times that I had checked.",1,Apple,2020-08-06
"Can't see what you're getting Good idea for an app but not suitable for anyone with dietary preferences or allergens. Fair enough that it's a surprise in the aim to get the food gone, but at least some indication of if it's vegan/ vegetarian would allow vegans & vegetarians to use the service without wasting money buying mystery food only to find they can't eat it.",5,Apple,2019-05-02
Simple yet fantastic idea! This is a fabulous idea - save food from being wasted and enable consumers to enjoy a bargain! The mystery about what you might receive adds a touch of fun and there are so many options too. Perfect for people on low budgets and essential for anyone who hates wasting food.,5,Apple,2021-11-01
"Superb idea First time of using this app. so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. Very easy to follow. Great instructions and reminders. I live alone and don‚Äôt always wish to cook just for myself. This was perfect. I chose the shop, paid a small fee, popped in, showed the app, and away I went! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Fab idea. Thank you.",5,Apple,2021-05-16
Genius! I wish this had been around when I was a poor single mother! Our first bag from Budgens was huge and had enough food to make several meals! Love the fact we are also saving this food from going to waste. Can‚Äôt wait to use again!,5,Apple,2020-12-14
"Fantastic magic bag A real variety, we have done this 3 times now and not had the same item twice. Really good variety of bakery goods and premium quality. A couple of the items alone are worth more than the cost of the whole contents. A real treat. Thank you!",5,Apple,2020-10-03
"Location The location doesn‚Äôt seem to be accurate I used the two  map options from the app both gave different locations none of which where the cafe, I googled the name myself and found it that way",5,Apple,2020-09-30
"Best saving food app We all win with this app, you amazing deals from great places, and businesses get some money for food that would have been wasted! 
The app classifies offers in categories, distances and pick up times. Which is great to find what you want fast and easy",5,Apple,2020-01-10
Great amount of food with a conscience! Meant to try this app while living in the UK as the amount of food I saw go to waste on a daily working at events and such made me so upset. Finally got to try it in France tonight and wow delicious food and with amazing value. Not to mention a great way to eat healthy for less and creative by less food waste in the world!,5,Apple,2019-11-05
"First time Wow first time used this app. Will def use again ladies in Restaurant we‚Äôre so nice and friendly. As they were still cooking I got offered free coffee, my granddaughter got offered a coke. Well it fed 3 of us nicely still some left over 5/5. Chef was so pleasant when bought food out asking if we want napkins great service will def eat in restaurant x seaside",5,Apple,2019-10-05
"Fantastic customer support I have not used this app for that long however I am please try surprised.
When I accidentally ordered some food which I thought was for tomorrow but was actually in a hours time I quickly messaged the customer support and they almost immediately cancelled and refunded my order.",5,Apple,2019-03-19
"Good app, but I would like to take my own containers The app works well and users can find good deals. In order to help the planet a bit more I would like to suggest to have the option of taking take my own box containers to be used to carry the food.",5,Apple,2021-10-15
"Sometimes the app crashes, just as you are going to pick up your collection‚Ä¶ Very frustrating!! Why does the app crash just before pick up? Thankfully the shop knows me and could see my ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù screen, so I was able to collect. Had to notify you of collection later‚Ä¶",4,Apple,2021-12-24
Fantastic! Such a simple app to use. Used the app 4 times now and haven‚Äôt experienced any problems either with the app or the food. I‚Äôm kind of obsessed with it! All for a good cause and it gives advice to make your food last longer. Keep it up!,5,Apple,2020-12-04
A great idea What a great way of reducing food waste and picking up a bargain. A friend told me about the app a few days ago and we‚Äôve had 2 boxes already with 2 more to come and we are yet to be disappointed. When more companies get on board it will only get better.,5,Apple,2020-02-27
"Need reviews! I love this app - I use it constantly when I am out, but as the portion sizes and quality of food varies so much shop to shop, it‚Äôd be great if we could see people‚Äôs reviews of the restaurant‚Äôs too good to go bag. 

Some will just give you a loaf of bread and a croissant for ¬£4, and others will give you two large quiches and two large cakes which they will let you choose for the same price! 

Seeing reviews would make this app 5 star !",2,Apple,2020-11-17
"Great Value - just needs some planning We all love a bargain, and want the same quality as full paying customers. My experience so far has been positive - the same service and food quality as you expect - however, organise yourself to arrive in plenty of time to collect your food.",5,Apple,2019-06-09
Brilliant app could have a lot more functionality Love the app and the idea! I truly believe that there could be added functions like push notifications when near a pick up point that still has food left and stuff but I‚Äôm sure your devs are busy working on more useful functions:) Love it!,5,Apple,2018-11-18
"Learn who to avoid I‚Äôve seen plenty of negative reviews. We only buy from our local Greggs and the nearby Toby carvery, both have excellent nutritious variety. I personally won‚Äôt do any Spar shops or coffee shops, Spar food is awful and coffee shops are overpriced so the savings aren‚Äôt there. Read reviews and go for bakeries!",5,Apple,2021-07-04
"All round great Good cause and get some really good hauls and can try different food or stores for a fraction of the cost. If you have questions, queries or issues the too good to go team are really accessible and responsive. Been using around 18 months and have nothing bad to say",5,Apple,2020-12-19
"Great app but tweaks needed It‚Äôs great to have an app like this but what would really help is a button where you could let the store/venue know you are vegetarian/vegan/other. 
Obviously I know that availability isn‚Äôt guaranteed but it would be easier than trying to get a call centre to put you through to a local store.

Amazing Idea Love the fact that you can order food like this for two reasons. Helps lessen the waste and also it‚Äôs so nice to have a decent meal to take away rather than all the other take away options. Nickelodeon was so amazing. Friendly people and very helpful. Would definitely recommend,5,Apple,2019-09-26
Happy ending Ordered first time my Too Good To Go and curiously went for Lola cupcakes. Arrived a bit earlier to pick up my order and wasn‚Äôt sure if they‚Äôd give it to me. The assistant first was reluctant though in the end I was given my 4 delicious Lola cupcakes. It was utmost highlight of my well started down the hill gone day.

"Finally a good selection! I‚Äôd been meaning to try this app for a while, but only recently has it got a decent selection of establishments in my local area. Now it has I can say the concept is great and the execution even better! I got bread and pastries from my local bakery for less than half of what they normally cost!",5,Apple,2019-03-22
Fantastic Idea It‚Äôs an good app it‚Äôs saving businesses from chucking away unsold food the only thing I would like to have is the app to notify me when there is magic bags available in my area rather than having to keep looking several times a day.,5,Apple,2021-01-30
"Great app and concept So the idea and the app are great but there is a seriously spectacularly frustrating animation on the map. Every single time I move the map the the bloody ‚Äòshow more stores here‚Äô button disappears and then pops up, disappears then pops up, disappears then pops up!!! Tried searching a few areas and thought I was going to have an epileptic fit. Either leave it off the screen or leave it on the screen. Please!",2,Apple,2021-06-29
"MrDB Great idea, great app!
Really don‚Äôt have much bad to say but if there‚Äôs anything that could make it better I‚Äôd have to say add more store‚Äôs to the app so there‚Äôs more variety food wise. 
Also having to wait till a certain pick up time too but for what you get it‚Äôs worth it.",5,Apple,2020-01-27
"What a great concept Been on a few of these apps before and none have lived up to expectations. 
This is the one exception, great app guys hope you get more places around ancoats, I work at Edinburgh castle and it‚Äôs so much better than trying to get to a shop before work.",5,Apple,2020-01-25
"Great offers if they‚Äôre local to you Having been watching the offers on the site for a week or 2, i took th plunge at lunchtime and for ¬£3, I got 2 tasty baguettes, with side & a soup.

"Good app, easy to use It‚Äôs a good app and easy to use. Don‚Äôt expect any restaurants to do anything for free but expect a bag full of random stuff for a discounted price. You don‚Äôt get to pick what‚Äôs really in the bag, given that it‚Äôs left over stuff but if your not overly picky it‚Äôs a great way to save money and reduce food waste. 
Would be nice to see more restaurants and food places start using the app.",4,Apple,2019-11-08
"Excellent app and concept Have tried it for the first time with Paul in Canary Wharf in London. For ¬£3.59, rescued a large tuna baguette, lots of small pastries and a large pain au chocolat. All food very fresh and excellent value.

Will definitely use again and hope more places sign up.",5,Apple,2019-07-13
"Such an amazing idea! Honestly, I‚Äôve just found this app from a friend, and I thought I‚Äôd give it a go with the greggs across the road. For ¬£2.58 I got 2 baguettes, 3 pasties and 2 desserts! Plus the food isn‚Äôt getting wasted or thrown away! Such a great idea.

The app is easy to use and so straightforward too!",5,Apple,2021-10-19
"Very good Collected my magic box today. Had bread, cakes, fruit and veg. Some items still had a few more days of use on. What I don‚Äôt use immediately can be frozen. 
Well worth the money. Very pleased with what I received. Definitely will try to get another one.",5,Apple,2020-02-12
amazing!! but‚Ä¶. such an amazing idea but i really wish you were able to select diet options - would love to get some bags from costa or greggs but am worried that I‚Äôd get some non vegetarian things which would be wasted. even an option to leave a note to the cafe or shop requesting veggie options would be great,4,Apple,2021-09-06
"Frustrating I have had this app for about 2 weeks or so now and received 1 magic bag which I was very satisfied with. However since then I have got none. Every time a place pops up I reserve it and get a notification saying they don‚Äôt have any food, this is getting very frustrating now as it happens every time so I am considering deleting this app",3,Apple,2021-05-05
"Brilliant idea! Really easy app to use and quite a few options around town to choose from already. Excellent value for money, especially if you want to try somewhere out first before paying full price or are looking for a good deal for dinner. Can't recommend it enough!",5,Apple,2017-09-06
"Nothing in my area. Loved the concept so downloaded the app. I live in the centre of a town in N.Devon so thought there may be somewhere that participated in the scheme but no, nothing. I can‚Äôt comment on the app as I didn‚Äôt really get to use it but signing in was easy enough. I will delete the  app for now and try again in 6 mnths. Maybe it‚Äôs just major cities that participate not towns?",4,Apple,2019-08-24
"Great app and concept, 1 tiny request for improvement... Love the app and design, great to see that such a strong UI being applied to an app that does some good on the world - well done. 

It would be great to have the ability to add the food pickup appointments to your calendar, that way no chance of forgetting and letting that delicious food end up where it shouldn't.

Keep up the great work!",4,Apple,2019-01-08
"Not getting left over It was saying on the app that you will get what wasn't being sold during the day.I paid ¬£3,99 for left over food from a restaurant.
I arrived at the restaurant at 22:20 and been told nothing was left when this restaurant was still open and serving customer. The waiter then told me to wait and he will see if he can get me something then came back 5 min later and gave me 2 slice of white bread, a small portion of plain white rice and a small box of chicken hearth wihch was disgusting so I actually ended wasting it.
Better going to macdonalds.",1,Apple,2017-09-22
"First timer buyer I can‚Äôt believe how easy it was the staff was amazing helping me sort out the app when I got to spar in Burntwood. It‚Äôs my first time to do this. And I loved it. Couldn‚Äôt believe the amount of meat I had for 3.09. 
Truly amazing. Will definitely be doing it again. 
Thank you.",5,Apple,2021-07-30
Greggs There was so much in the bag I picked up the  lady was very helpful as I didn‚Äôt know were to go she came out with my bag and I said is that all for me and she said yes hope you enjoy it will definitely be going back there when they are available,5,Apple,2021-05-30
"My first ‚ÄòMagic Box‚Äô After trying daily all week to reserve a Morrisons Magic Box in Birmingham,I finally managed to get one! Yayyyyy!

"Great idea Used TooGoodToGo for the first time today. Tried the app out of curiosity more than anything else. Got a good sized roast pork dinner with a massive amount of pigs in blankets on it. I‚Äôm sure the homeless guy I gave the meal to enjoyed it. 

Probably not too fussed to use this app for meals, but definitely will keep an eye for the Morrison‚Äôs deals.",5,Apple,2019-12-29
"Best thing since sliced bread I have only had 2 deals however both have been so worth it, the morrisons box was by farrr the best, easily ¬£30 worth of food, things that you can put in the freezer for a later date I want to have them all!",5,Apple,2019-12-09
"Great app and lessen food wastage The app is great, easy to use and clear in its instructions. It helps not to waste good food and helping a lot of people on a budget. Great value for money and i hope that food that is not sold could be donated to homeless people of the streets of London. Highly recommendüòÑüòÑüòÑ",5,Apple,2021-07-21
"Great food Looked at the menu and loved it, was not sure how good it would be but it was spot on, as a family we all enjoyed it and the cake banana and mocha was moist and creamy despite it being the evening.
Definitely worth 5 stars and I will be back and wish the owners every success x",5,Apple,2021-05-23
"A very generous box! Maybe it was today‚Äôs snow that had meant slow sales. But whatever the reason my huge box of fruit and veg exceeded all expectations. Both members of staff that served me today were friendly and very helpful, and the system was well organised.",5,Apple,2021-01-14
Great concept Really good concept. I think it may be a good idea if you could filter out things like pork seafood fish for example as not everyone would be able to have that. As far as i could see the only filers were none vegetarian or vegan.,5,Apple,2020-11-25
"Wow! This was an awesome deal and the staff were really lovely and quick when it came to handing it over. I wish I could afford to shop here normally... maybe when COVID is over and I‚Äôm back at work! But meanwhile, what a great way to save waste and help local people. Thanks!",5,Apple,2021-01-22
"Fail, fail, fail and fail Seriously don‚Äôt bother... I have now attempted 5 orders, the first wouldn‚Äôt accept my card, the next three accepted but the morning of collection were cancelled, the fourth (and final time I will attempt to use this app) was cancelled as I was walking into the store to collect my ‚Äúmagic bag‚Äù collection time was 2pm cancelled at 2 07... so the Sunday last minute baby sitter and the 4 pound in fuel I wasted to go to the store I had no other reason to be visiting added to my carbon footprint!

Waste of time",1,Apple,2020-10-11
"What a waste of fuel, time and patience Went to collect my box from Morrison‚Äôs in Newquay only to be told it was cancelled as no food left... explained to rude member of staff that it was still showing as active on the app and low and behold it was cancelled before my very eyes after a few clicks of her buttons! She couldn‚Äôt care less that I‚Äôd come miles out of my way and I did send you guys a message about my disappointment and no one ever got back to me so I wouldn‚Äôt use this service again.",1,Apple,2020-08-27
"Okay if you live in a city Twice my order has been cancelled when I ordered and there were more bags to be had. They said they had sold out at midnight. My order was at 6pm. Then the next day it was cancelled due to no surplus food. So don‚Äôt believe the hype of some reviews. The one bag I did get, from another place was good.  But unless you live in a city this app isn‚Äôt for you.",3,Apple,2019-12-18
"Outstanding app During the last 5 months things have been extremely hard,finding this app and getting food has really helps 
Thank you so much for helping my family",5,Apple,2020-08-30
Mostly Fine However not impressed with the Morrison‚Äôs pick ups. As yet I‚Äôve never managed a pick up as they‚Äôre gone within seconds. It also doesn‚Äôt help when you‚Äôre competing with employees who know the exact time the deals get posted who also get 15% staff discounts.,4,Apple,2020-12-24
Amaaaazing! I love love love this app. Had 6 fantastic meals for a great value since I downloaded it and more to come...Thank you so much for creating this app! To the developer: You made me save so much money in London and eat better and healthier and feel great because I‚Äôm saving food too. I love you <3,5,Apple,2019-11-30
Waste of time Amazingly the sale ends before it even begins (Morrison‚Äôs) I‚Äôve checked every day since downloading this app possibly about 4 weeks ago. The sale never happens 6:00 o‚Äôclock it says sale ended then a few minutes later it comes up with sold out at some random time after 6. Some stores will say nothing left which is understandable but I can‚Äôt understand how anyone can get a bag at all when it doesn‚Äôt even happen. Very disappointing,1,Apple,2020-08-17
"Review Very good app and I use it often. I think that the favourites should appear at the top and that any store with availability should be shown first in the favourites. Also, I‚Äôm an English speaker but live in Belgium and I cannot change the language of the blog, which is very disappointed, as I would like to read it.",4,Apple,2020-06-19
Living the dream This app is amazing ! I‚Äôm eating a way more varied and healthy diet from the best restaurants less than my grocery shopping costs and it‚Äôs made for me all I do is pick it up ... on top of all that it‚Äôs good for the environment and prevents waste !!! Why isn‚Äôt everyone doing this ?!,5,Apple,2019-11-29
"Fantastic concept The person/people who created this app are actually brilliant. Very easy to use so far, purchase your food then go to said food outlet and person serving swipes and transaction complete. So much to choose from wherever you are - this will be great in the fight against food waste!",5,Apple,2018-12-19
"Best App Around Everyone should use this app, or at least try it a few times. I cannot find fault with the scheme and it‚Äôs easy to see how everyone involved, from customer to supplier, benefits from this system. Use and share!",5,Apple,2020-10-30
"Terrible customer service and faulty automation I brought a bag and ended up going all the way to collect it just to be told there was no bags left and I should‚Äôve been notified. 

They owner said that ‚ÄòToo Good Too Go‚Äô has been falsely putting bags on the site on their behalf and even though they‚Äôve told them, this keeps happening. I wonder how many other people have had this same issue.

This is a complete waste of time and I‚Äôd avoid it if I were you.",1,Apple,2021-04-12
"IBIS Canning Town First experience of using Too Good to Go and I was a little sceptical.  Excellent customer service from the hotel, the lady took me to the breakfast buffet, gave me a box and after explaining why they used this app, left me to fill the box. Excellent selection with everything available as if I‚Äôd paid full price.",5,Apple,2019-11-02
What a brilliant idea! I‚Äôve been using this app for a few months now and rescuer plenty of amazing food for just a few pounds. I‚Äôve also told my students to install the app and make a use of it and save some money. Just brilliant! Thanks to everyone who was involved in creating it!,5,Apple,2019-10-07
Meeting the right staff makes a huge difference Just want to say that sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to get the reasonable amount of boxes when you don‚Äôt have the experienced staff at the pickup time. Really liked my experience in the past couple pickup times tho! Thank you üòÅ,5,Apple,2018-12-31
"Such a good concept but not always the best outcome I was so excited when I found this app - most places near me (Streatham) charged ¬£3-¬£4 for a ‚Äòmagic bag‚Äô which you have no choice in how it is filled. On my first try, I was given 3 quite stale croissants for ¬£3.99 and was really disappointed as I expected a little more than 3 old croissants. As you can‚Äôt select what you‚Äôre given, I imagine you often end up dissatisfied.",3,Apple,2019-08-21
"Vegetarian Option Please! I really like the idea of this app, I think it‚Äôs fantastic, and will only get better as more restaurants join in (currently only two within 15 miles of Norwich UK).
I understand it would be quite a hard thing to do due to the nature of the idea, but I think it‚Äôd be great if there was an option to request a vegetarian or vegan magic bag.",4,Apple,2019-07-25
"Good app, depends on the place Heard a lot of good stuff about the app, however brought some stuff from a place and for what they gave it wasn‚Äôt far off their normal price and really didn‚Äôt get much, felt like I got a meal deal really. Whole point I brought from here is to reduce waste but probably better off going to the super market to be quite honest. For what I paid would have been better of at the shops",3,Apple,2019-07-10
"Perfect! A lovely interface and generally well designed app that‚Äôs very easy to navigate.

The main plus of course is how it connects you to places that would otherwise throw their food away, it‚Äôs a great way to get cheap and tasty food for your self and save the environment!

Everyone wins! Highly recommended",5,Apple,2018-08-03
"Vegetarian option I wonder if it is possible to choose a vegetarian option . I got chicken sandwich from a bakery, which I do not eat. Was upset about this , though made use of the sandwich after taking out chicken slices.
Thank you very much!",5,Apple,2021-03-12
"Third time lucky, no! My first order, for Costa I went to collect and it had closed 20 minutes before my allocated delivery time. I knocked as there were staff still there and was told they didn‚Äôt have anything left. Second try, arrived on time told nothing left at M&S. Third time again told they had nothing left. That‚Äôs money paid that you cannot get a refund on, just be aware if you get there and they don‚Äôt have anything you don‚Äôt get a refund!",1,Apple,2021-11-21
"No good if you have any allergies Downloaded but deleted as there was no way to exclude wheat products, which I can‚Äôt have in the house. It just said sorry as your magic bag is a surprise there‚Äôs no way to predict what you will get.
It seems a shame as I‚Äôd happily have fruit, veg, meat, fish, dairy and anything rice based etc but I cannot risk being landed with a bag of standard pastries or bread.
I can see that they just want to get rid of what they have but this must be excluding a huge percentage of the population.",1,Apple,2021-08-08

The bag came packed full: bag of bread and butter; spaghetti bolognaise; box of vegetables; pot of beef soup with beef sausages; box of garlic rice; and box of mixture of meats (chicken thighs and pork chunks). Food was all fresh and delicious and the server who helped was lovely to us. Will definitely use again- cost us ¬£4 and ended up being 3 meals!",5,Apple,2019-11-15
"Worth a try After my first dismal experience at lunchtime (nothing available when i arrived) i have had three successful pickups at different locations (won‚Äôt go back to the first!). I find this a helpful way to grab some nice grub on the go, after work. Still doesn‚Äôt beat home cooking! :)",4,Apple,2020-02-21

"Disappointed. Not happy... I liked the idea of the app and thought I‚Äôd give it a go. 

Spent ¬£3.69 on a ‚Äúmagic bag‚Äù that was meant to be worth ¬£10. Well... I have to say I‚Äôm seriously disappointed. What I got was hardly worth much above ¬£5. So I don‚Äôt get how it was meant to be of ¬£10 value. 

Maybe it works for some people and some vendors are being ‚Äúfair‚Äù however this felt like it was free advertising for the vendor. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd try it again and I‚Äôd warn others to think twice if you want to try this app. Be prepared for disappointment.",1,Apple,2019-06-02
Makes complete sense! I think this is a fab way to make sure less food is wasted. It also gives you an opportunity to try something you might not otherwise!,5,Apple,2020-09-25
"Imdredible! Download now There is nothing more to say that what a better way to avoid waste, save money and know new places. We should be doing more of this apps for other areas that need to fight waste! Incredible! Just go and download it NOW!",5,Apple,2020-01-20
"Great idea! What a smart idea - amazing value food and cutting waste. Just saved my first meal - a mosey along a Hilton breakfast buffet - and will definitely be back. The lovely, helpful man I spoke to in the restaurant says they‚Äôve had problems with the odd person totally taking the mickey (whole loaf in a bag, anyone? üôÑ) so this‚Äôll only work if folk play fair.

My ¬£3.59 was great value I received a filled rolled (veggie)which I ate for a late lunch, 2 vegan mango and passion fruit cakes which are utterly delicious and 3 fruit scones which I have frozen for a later date. The app is super easy to use and really what‚Äôs not to like ?",5,Apple,2019-07-28
"Brilliant idea, easy to use app The idea is brilliant and really well executed. The app is friendly abd easy to use. I kinda like the idea of a surprise bag, it adds to the experience. I placed two orders: one was a massive portion of chicken and chips (good value), the other a pretty amazing bag from Wenzel, full of savoury and sweet snacks, terrific value. Vastly recommended.",5,Apple,2019-07-19
Dietary requirements Downloaded this app after a YouTuber recommendation (Clickfortaz) and sounds absolutely amazing but just from initial viewing there was not an easy option to select Halal food only? Or a vegetarian option apart from that an amazing amazing concept and can‚Äôt wait to try out for myself!,5,Apple,2019-05-14
"Amazing, exciting, good for wallet and environment. Used TGTG for first time this evening at Paul at St Pancras. I got a salade ni√ßoise, croque monsieur and tarte aux fraises got ¬£3.59, usual RRP ¬£10!!! Staff asked if I had any dietary requirements and was taken into account. 

Ordered it as I got on tube, and it was waiting for me 15 minutes later on arrival. I will definitely be using this service again (absolute no brainier).",5,Apple,2019-01-12

The others shops seem to be working as intended though.",3,Apple,2021-02-20
Good idea but not enough supermarkets/shops involved Good idea not much in my area. I used to miss the slot to try but one of these but everytime I go on everything is sold out. Past 2-3 days I‚Äôve been trying for Morrison‚Äôs tgtg box but All 4 Morrison‚Äôs have stopped doing TGTG boxes in my area. Kind of put off and not going to bother . Seems like too many customers and not enough sellers or participants . Would be great if all supermarkets got involved in this rather just the odd corner shop or cafe,1,Apple,2021-01-20
"Great concept but often disappointing I love the idea of this app, but unfortunately I‚Äôve found that often during an evening pick up I‚Äôm given breakfast pastries that I have no use for at that time of day.

Great ethical app.. savings all round I love the app. It‚Äôs fun to use with great savings. I have had some delicious food at fantastic prices. The variety available is good.

"Morrison‚Äôs Livingston Very happy with my magic box, great mix of veg, some in date and some just out of date. Also got two loafs, pack of pittas and a pack of apple slices. Well done Morrison‚Äôs will definitely use again. Value at the full price was approximately ¬£14!",5,Apple,2021-10-07

"Good idea.  Save waste. Save money Bringing foraging to modern day eating.  Find discounts. And surprises. 
Easy to use app find a bargain , pay for it , tells your where to go, reminds you to go now.  

We generally get a pleasant surprise from the companies giving discounts mystery bags

Saves me having to root through bins in the middle of the night, with all the inherent fox dangers. 

My only gripe is ‚Äúfont contrast‚Äù. Really white on pale grey , and dark grey on olive are invisible to my retired eyes. Could also use a larger font perhaps?

Vegetarian friendly? I have downloaded this app and am yet to order from it. Being based outside of London my choices are much less limited...but still tempting! What holds me back currently is the guarantee that I will get vegetarian-friendly food in my box. Perhaps there should be an option for this when ordering?,4,Apple,2019-09-09
Great app but could be improved I‚Äôve used the app a few times now and it‚Äôs a fantastic idea. Been happy with each of my purchases.

And just for fun you can‚Äôt tell if you need a car or not, it‚Äôs pure chance (the store may say DT but you can go in, but it can also say DT and you have to drive thru - they have no system in place to clarify this even after I pointed it out to them) So don‚Äôt bother wasting your time if you don‚Äôt drive.",1,Apple,2021-03-03
"Wenzels Baker Street Tube Great service yesterday evening when I went to pick up my bag. Good selection and delicious baguette to eat on the way home! What more could you ask for?
Thanks also to TfL staff who allowed me to go through the barrier to pick it up!

"Absolutely first class food Well worth the money we paid 
The food was hot and there was plenty of it 
Can‚Äôt recommend highly enough would definitely use the app again",5,Apple,2019-11-22
"Great app, great idea! Great app, great idea. I‚Äôve only tried it at Wenzels so far but I love it and and live the lucky dip aspect of it. Great for lunches for the next day for work too. I wish in my area more restaurants/cafes were part of it as it would be nice to have more choice but hopefully in the future there will be!

A very happy customer I used this App for the first time tonight. We went to a well known Carvery in Reading. Was a bit skeptical about what we would get. Wow we got loads of food. We have just eaten and stuffed now. There is enough to freeze for 3 more meals for a family of 3. Well done great initiative.,5,Apple,2019-08-09
Great Idea! I heard about this on the radio 04Aug19. So I downloaded the App right away and used it. Ease of use is very good and the vendor was working on my order as soon as I mentioned my bag ‚Äòto go‚Äô. Only need to see a lot more eateries in Cambridge to sign up to this. I will be using this service often!,5,Apple,2019-08-04
"5* idea Absolutely love this app and this idea! Me and my boyfriend have used it a few times and I‚Äôve told all my friends about it! The food we have received has been beautiful and the staff always have plenty of choices, would definitely recommend!",5,Apple,2019-06-30
"Genuinely the Best Thing in my Life. This is the world‚Äôs best kept secret. You can eat from all of your favourite cafes/restaurants (and discover many new favourites too!), at a fraction of the ordinary price, with astonishingly large portion sizes too! I don‚Äôt think I understood true happiness until I was introduced to this wonder... Thank you. üíï",5,Apple,2018-10-25
First time This was the first time I‚Äôd used the app and purchased a bag. I used a local spar and got a bag of food at a third of the price with a good selection of products all of which I can use. The staff were excellent and really helpful too,5,Apple,2021-11-24
"It worth trying! So far, I have not been disappointed with my surprises bags. I have tried a few different places, some which I didn‚Äôt know about it. Always yummy food, good portions and value for money.",5,Apple,2021-08-15
"OMG! üòç As soon as I entered the shop, I was quickly presented with two bags of food I‚Äôd ordered! Had lots of meat which I‚Äôve frozen. I am stunned at the simplicity and amazing value of this app, and feel proud I‚Äôm helping to stop so much food going to waste! Thanks ‚ÄúToo Good to go‚Äù.",5,Apple,2021-03-09
Awesome app Great idea and really well executed. Only suggestion would be notifications from my favourite restaurants when there is food available as I don‚Äôt check the app at the right times and I miss out,5,Apple,2020-09-09
"Nicolas y Valero This magic box is more ingredients than a meal, I received 5kg of dried pasta, 2kg of mascarpone with a 2 month bbe date yum, a tin coconut milk, a large package of dried pesto nuts and some very unusual looking frozen fruits which I can't remember the name of. The box far exceeds the price and is a bargain for ingredients but remember it's not a ready cooked meal, thanks again guys",5,Apple,2019-06-13
"Bake out Southwick is fab! We often get goodie bags from there, they are always amazing. Lots of food, lovely quality, really friendly staff. One of the guys gave my little boy an extra sausage roll on top of an already generous bag of food this time, which was so kind (and has since been eaten!). Top marks every time.",4,Apple,2019-12-28
"Breakfast Novatel hotel Had family home for the weekend, so ordered 4 magic bags, we were not disappointed at all. We were able to choose our own food, we had a great selection of Welsh cheeses, meats, fruit, pastries and some lovely Bara Brith. Would definitely have again xx",5,Apple,2019-05-19
"Good choice Served straight away and enjoyed a delicious selection. Couldn‚Äôt be better. I like the healthy Leon products anyway and was able to try new ones, all good quality.
Friendly staff and big airy shop.",5,Apple,2021-08-20
"Lies Used this app three times over the space of a year and the customer experience is awful. The portion sizes are very small and restaurants use this to get rid of the dregs from what they haven‚Äôt sold that day. The first time I used it we were told to come to the restaurant between 4.30 and 5 - the place shut at 4 so we had wasted a trip for nothing, hardly eco friendly as it was a 10 minute drive. The concept is good but the execution is dreadful and feels like a scam. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this.",1,Apple,2018-11-03
"Reduce food waste or promotions for big chains This has really gone down hill fast. It used to be full of independent businesses reducing waste. A breakfast at midday for ¬£1.50. Food that would otherwise go in the bin. Post COVID lockdowns it‚Äôs all huge chains essentially offering a voucher for food they‚Äôve got anyway. The result is you‚Äôre not reducing food waste you‚Äôre just increasing footfall, and profit, for the chains at the expense of local independent businesses. Ethics out of the window in the pursuit of profit.",1,Apple,2021-07-25
"Great food and service When coming to collect the food the lady was really friendly and welcoming.

There was a great variety of food, and excellent value for money, will definitely be using this one again!",5,Apple,2021-05-18
Great app idea App is easy to set up and register. New local offers pop up frequently via email to keep me informed of deals in my area. Used it for the first time last night and will be a frequent user.,5,Apple,2019-12-10
"Food good, but notifications don‚Äôt work. We‚Äôve had a couple of magic bags from Gregg‚Äôs now. The food has been great and good value. The only problem is that I‚Äôve set the app up to receive notifications, but I don‚Äôt get any, so it‚Äôs hit and miss to there being any magic bags still available when I look on the app.",3,Apple,2021-03-10
Awful Used this app once and it failed me the first time itself. It‚Äôs being marketed as a fighting food wastage app. However that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs used. When you walk into the store you are not welcomed and often they give stale food that has gone bad. Since you have already paid you have little option but to take it. I wouldn‚Äôt use it again. It‚Äôs a scam used by shop keepers to get more customers at the end of the day.,1,Apple,2020-11-04
"Lauren Heywood The service at Greggs was second to none, very friendly and the person who served me said they made sure we got value for our money. Would definitely go there again!",5,Apple,2021-03-15
Great idea but only 3 of the 4 places on the site that have food I hate food waste especially with starving people and poor countries but also think this is a great idea but unfortunately there are only 4 places so far in Swindon but only 3 have things available all the time but hopefully more will join a,4,Apple,2019-10-23
Fantastic App This is such a fantastic app! We have had a couple of magic bags and have been really impressed each time! The app is simple to use and updated very quickly and regularly.,5,Apple,2021-02-01
Brilliant business idea I think that this is a BRILLIANT app and a really good way to save unwanted food. I have brought food a few times using this app and I have never been disappointed with what I have received in my magic bag.,5,Apple,2019-12-16
Morrisans todmorden Really happy with the food we received the box was full of food that we could eat and also freeze . I cook everything from fresh so the magic boxes are a great idea. I also make fresh soups with the vegetables in the box so nothing gets wasted at all üòä,5,Apple,2019-11-01
Pleasantly surprised! First time trying this app out and thought what‚Äôs the harm in spending ¬£3.50 to see what I get. I got a very decent magic bag from Starbucks. 3 filling sandwiches and a pastry. Great quality too. Will definitely use again!,5,Apple,2021-10-11
"Don‚Äôt want to see tomorrow‚Äôs options. Allow me to filter food only available today. Otherwise the results become cluttered with results that aren‚Äôt relevant if I‚Äôm looking for food right now. This wasn‚Äôt an issue before but now it shows food available for the next day.

Otherwise this app is great and I recommend it. Just add that as a filter and it‚Äôs perfect.",3,Apple,2018-07-12
"Royal Artisan Picked up my second bag today and was so pleased with it. Different to the first one which is great as I get to sample all the goods! Such good value and totally delicious. Will be popping in very soon for a coffee and almond croissant which are divine. Lovely staff, will definitely be back!",5,Apple,2021-06-06
Poor quality food Great idea but the food is generally sub standard. Stale bread rolls that can‚Äôt be sold or nasty old donuts that have seen better days generally. If you are choosing to use the app I would look at some bad reviews before to mitigate y to he risk of wasting time. Some people might not be bothered with the quality but personally I wouldn‚Äôt give some of that food away to a friend.,2,Apple,2021-06-23
"First time user I was unsure of what to expect when using this service for the first time. But absolutely fantastic.
I went with greggs to kick things off today. 2 bags stuffed with food. And fantastic staff as you would expect with greggs.",5,Apple,2021-06-01
"Would order again We use Parson Street regularly but this was the first time using Magic bags. We were really chuffed to get 2 x baguettes, 2 x custard slices, 2 x pain au chocolate and 2 x loaves of bread. Really great for ¬£3.99. This will be great for lunches for the next couple of days.",5,Apple,2021-03-27
Great value It is fantastic that food that would normally be wasted can be enjoyed. I thought that for my ¬£3 I can get a sandwich from my local Costa for the next day or something similar. Instead I got 5 delicious sandwiches and 2 croisants.,5,Apple,2020-09-25
"What an exciting activity during lockdown You could get a box full of bread products or a box full of fresh products or mixture or even things you may not even think about purchasing yourself.
Just have to use your thinking cap as much as possible to try and utilise the goodies you re urge.
 Best of luck all",3,Apple,2020-12-29
Has potential The app has great potential and is a brilliant way to save waste food. The only downfall is there is other 2 restaurants is N.Ireland which is pointless. Will try downloading again in few months to see if any change.,5,Apple,2019-01-05
Great idea nice presentation. Doesn't work too well The principle behind This is excellent but requires accurate cooperation with the vendors. Sadly the timings are completely inaccurate as everywhere is always sold out all the time and it is unclear whether times refer to sale times or pick up times. A few local places like Morrisons and some bakeries but none ever have anything available,2,Apple,2020-03-05
"Lack of vegetarian options Everything regarding the app is fine. 
My only issue is the lack of vegetarian options. I live very central in London, and therefore I normally have lots of vegetarian options in my area, but it is not reflected in the options I get through the app.",4,Apple,2021-11-09
Very good value from Fruit Connection in Edinburgh. Tha app makes it easy to find local shops and place an order. Our first magic bag is very good value. Looking forward to trying all local options.,5,Apple,2021-09-15
M and s food bag Ordering and collection really good but what was in the bag wasn‚Äôt really ideal for me there maybe should be a selection mine had yum yum a block of hard cheese a packet of peas and a pasta salad unfortunately no one wanted any of these items I  may grate the cheese,5,Apple,2021-07-23
"Great in theory not in practice. The idea of the App is super but you are at the mercy of the vendors as to whether they give you anything decent. I was massively underwhelmed with the products supplied. They were barely worth the price paid and nowhere near the value stated. The App works excellently, the vendors are unfortunately not as good.",4,Apple,2021-08-08
Glad we tried this. Great value. After a poor experience at a Spar we decided to try again. Pleased with the amount of vegetables. Lots of stir fried so food predictable for next few days but looked and tasted fresh!,5,Apple,2021-07-19
"Great app to prevent food waste I love the bags with the logo.  The last few times i have collected (from a deli, from small supermarket and from small distribution business). I have got loads of food and have then shared it on the olio app.  I love the lucky dip aspect",5,Apple,2021-04-24
"Good value if you‚Äôre not fussy There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great range of shops (mostly M&S, Costa and Budgens), but it‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre not a picky eater.

I got 3 toasties and a muffin from Costa, which is great value! Most shops are fairly local.

Collection times are quite late, but most places ask you to collect from 4-6pm.",4,Apple,2021-07-06
"Yummy food and a huge variety Not only can you get yummy food at such a great price, it‚Äôs such a great variety so you can try things you normally wouldn‚Äôt, all of this whilst helping reduce waste. 
This app is so easy to use and I love it",5,Apple,2021-01-04
Morrison‚Äôs store Really excellent value and a good variety of vegetables. All still in good edible condition. Would have been nice to vary the selection a bit as the store had lots of other items reduced but grateful for the items I received.,5,Apple,2020-11-13
Well good First time using the app. Wasn‚Äôt sure about the concept but have to say am now a convert. Easy to collect and fab selection of food from The Spar. Will do the same again. Well worth the effort. Thank you.,5,Apple,2020-10-19
"Excellent Went to customer service, they couldn‚Äôt find my order, the manager very kindly put an order together including some nice mince pies. The box was huge. Very happy with the box of goodies. Customer service was excellent.",5,Apple,2019-12-08
Rubbish I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this  I seen a place that was doing a mystery bag near me first time trying it so thought I‚Äôd give it a go only to get there my order wasn't even there and wasn't know about so the server picked some brick hard croissants off the shelf and handed me them.  I know it‚Äôs meant to be end of use by date but come on they weren‚Äôt even edible  they could smash glass they were that solid  I will not be using this app anymore,1,Apple,2020-09-11
Easy peasy app to use. I Used the app for the first time tonight. Even with a low battery I managed to book and collect my bag of goodies. This will become an awesome app as more stores subscribe to not throwing away food at the end of the day.,5,Apple,2019-11-27
"Fantastic app! Found this today and loved the concept of saving food from going to waste. Ended up ordering from one of my favourite carverys and was given a box to just go to the carvery and get what I wanted for half the price!

"Please make the NL version in English too I‚Äôve been using this a few weeks and have had some Amazing stuff that would otherwise have been thrown away. Great concept. A few bugs on the app need fixing, I was charged twice for one order, but other than that it‚Äôs brilliant.",4,Apple,2019-10-01
"Brilliant idea that actually works! We decided to give this a try and it all went well! I love the idea of the sort of lucky dip as well. 

This is a great idea to save food waste and we get some discounted food. Win win. Will be great to see other places join in too.",5,Apple,2019-05-25
"Win-win Very ethical concept, and for a nominal fee you can have a great feast! Not only can you use it with major outlets, but you can also use it with plenty of local eateries, thus giving them some custom and improving the community spirit a little bit.",5,Apple,2019-05-20

"Outlets advertise with this app. No saving here I was so excited to start saving food and cut down on waste. Saw this advert about this app so I downloaded it. What a load of rubbish. On the developers and their friends and partners must have left all the positive reviews. So disappointed as I thought this app was real.
All the outlets are doing is advertising themselves and not offering cheaper food at all. The prices are all near exactly the same as their full price. Terrible",1,Apple,2020-08-14
"Waste of my time and petrol Paid for one of the limited bags available the night before for ‚Äògo shushi‚Äô 
Turned up to collect well within my window time to be told that they only supply 5 bags to whoever turns up first, regardless of wether you have paid through the app (which blatantly shows availability)
Asked for a refund and will ask to be compensated fuel as the drive was a round trip of about 16 miles or so.

Don‚Äôt bother, stay clear!",1,Apple,2019-11-22

Only one thing to change Very good. But if I could add or change one thing then I would add a notification when something comes on offer in my range,5,Apple,2021-11-04
MISSING COLLECTION I love the app BUT i‚Äôve missed multiple collections now because the app only notifies half an hour before collection and never again! Which is ridiculous because most of the time I collect from very local shops 5 minutes away. It‚Äôs a simple feature so please consider implementing it.,3,Apple,2021-11-07

"The worst app in the world They literally make you pay for food they‚Äôre about to throw in the bin, sometimes it is food they literally couldn‚Äôt sell for about 3p but they charge you nearly full price for it.

Perfect for a pensioner on a very tight budget I use the app every day it saves me so much money as I live on a small state pension with no other income it gives me a fantastic choice of food that I could not usually afford,5,Apple,2021-10-11
"Absolutely ridiculous and unreasonable So you are telling me that if I buy something and don't make it within the collection window the food goes to waste and I don't get a refund? Which translates to ""we're still keeping your money..."". How could you even consider that??? I am absolutely shocked by the fact that you haven't taken this possibility into account.
Also, the super overly fake sweet email that you send are just very annoying, please grow up.",1,Apple,2019-01-14

Great selection in Birmingham I collected my first magic bag the other day and it was great. I got a delicious cooked meal & drink I wouldn‚Äôt have cooked myself.

"Flawed implementation Little variation, and quite restrictive. A lunch order will cost the same as a normal lunch, but it give you three times more food than you can eat, which means you will be the one throwing it away. orders will be the least attractive stuff on the menu. Miss your collection window by just a minute and they will throw your order in the bin immediately. Feels like a con to pay for someone‚Äôs trash.",1,Apple,2021-10-20

I even got to choose the meat (turkey & chipolatas), Yorkshire pud, self serve vegetables and even a pot of gravy! Was yummy and could‚Äôve been split between two as I had plenty of meat and still have left over veg! 
Very easy to do.",5,Apple,2019-08-27
Wish more companies would join! There is really one venue near me that does this but luckily it‚Äôs a carvery. Had a lovely magic bag (actually a gravy proof cardboard takeaway box) with delicious veggies and some meat. Lush! I just wish more pubs etc would sign up as it‚Äôs a bargain and stops waste.,5,Apple,2019-07-14
"Great idea Great idea, reduces food waste/being thrown away. Users get cheaper meals while the vendors make money on things that would otherwise have been thrown away. Still getting used to the new interface",5,Apple,2019-06-22
First time using and pleasantly surprised! First time using the app at yo sushi in Glasgow and pleasantly surprised. We bought 2 meals for a total of ¬£7 and got tons! Still fresh and husband was delighted. Will totally be back! Hopefully see some more local places popping up soon.,5,Apple,2019-01-04
"Great First time ordering from TGTG from this place . Throughly impressed . Great value, good amount and the food was delicious . Transaction was quick, efficient and friendly . Will definitely order again",5,Apple,2021-10-24
"Fantastic Idea We are new to Too Good to Go, but have been pleased with the bags we have bought so far . Quite like the surprise of not knowing what you might get, adds to the fun, whilst reducing food waste.",5,Apple,2021-06-26
Love it Very good app you get great food for a lot cheaper then you would normally. I wished more places used it but otherwise great and would recommend 49 cafe if you‚Äôre near it since it‚Äôs delicious,5,Apple,2021-05-27
"Disappointing So far my experiences with this app have been incredibly disappointing. Each use I have received extremely small amounts of food that were either completely stale/gone off or just not very nice. Each time was barely worth what I paid for it. On several occasions, when collecting, the staff at the stores have been incredibly rude and acted like I was a burden or  a beggar or something.",1,Apple,2021-06-11
"Fantastic idea to reduce food waste and grab a bargain! Only just heard about this app, I‚Äôm already spreading the word!
The spar grocery deal was very varied, fruit, veg and salad as well as other perishables.
Really really happy to grab a bargain but more importantly reduce food waste",5,Apple,2021-05-04
"Costa bag Yesterday I purchased my first too good to go box and I was so chuffed and impressed with it, we got 2 sandwiches and 2 cakes and they were delicious and still very fresh, can‚Äôt wait to get my next one",5,Apple,2021-02-07
Fancy a delicious two course meal for under a fiver? Save monty without sacrificing your taste buds pick up delicious food for dinner st the end of the day at Bergson prices and discover gems in your local area! plus feel warm and fuzzy about reducing waste,5,Apple,2020-02-17
Chelmsford Morrison‚Äôs. First time I have got a box from Morrison‚Äôs in Chelmsford but a lovely box. Normally get a box from Maldon Morrison‚Äôs but hasn‚Äôt been the best of late and not much selection. Enough veg this time from Chelmsford in there and also 2 cheeky Morrison‚Äôs the best cakes.,5,Apple,2020-01-16
Great idea... never anything left though No option for notifications of when things go on sale/become available so for that reason I‚Äôve never managed to get anything from too good to go. Great idea but the actual number of people who benefit from it is minimal,3,Apple,2020-02-10
Friday evening food sorted! First time using this app and very happy with our food from The Juice Bar MK - only slight downside is no labels so don‚Äôt know exactly what the food is but there‚Äôs a decent sized salmon salad and 2 hearty and different soups/curry without the rice - very tasty! Will definitely use again.,5,Apple,2019-11-01
"Great idea I love this help stop food waste. The only sad thing is, in my area are only 3 places that participate. All supermarkets and convenience stores should take part in this initiative . At least my kids had a delicious Lola Cupcakes today. Thank you for starting this movement ‚ù§Ô∏è",4,Apple,2019-11-29
Bitter sweet Mixed emotions really. Incredible how much food I got today for so cheap but I despaired at the amount still left that was going to be thrown away. Cannot knock what this service is trying to do - it is truly admirable but wow to uncover how much will still be wasted is heart wrenching.,5,Apple,2019-09-09
Great idea ‚ò∫Ô∏è This is such a wonderful app. I‚Äôve only used it a few tones but everything has been beautiful and great value for money. The portions have always been generous and tasty and the food is still fresh. Such a good idea to cut down food waste,5,Apple,2019-06-29
Here is a suggestion I really like the idea and i am glad that there is a possibility for people to actually do something to help. I think that if you would introduce delivery as well it would be more convenient for everyone and more people would consider help reducing food waste,4,Apple,2019-08-31
"Hard to do well I support the idea, but shops make business out of this. Small portions, they are not willing to accept using your own bag (to save waste). It feels like they put 10 bags on the app and distribute the leftover across the bags end of day, even if there‚Äôs just 4 pieces in each bag.

The app has introduced ratings to counteract that. This is the right way to go.",3,Apple,2019-08-15
"Love it Great idea, really well executed. The food I have had has been amazing, and I absolutely love the idea.  Really easy to do and more restaurants should sign up! 
Great food, great cause and you get to try new places that want to be more environmentally friendly",5,Apple,2019-04-01
"Saving the world, one sandwich at a time! I love this app, I use it when I‚Äôm coming home late and can‚Äôt decide what to eat! It‚Äôs crazy to think that all this perfectly good food would end up in the bin if we weren‚Äôt saving it so thank you, Too Good To Go!",5,Apple,2018-10-08
"Misleading but good idea I‚Äôve used this once but found it very misleading - I appreciate the idea is to reduce waste but the app suggests you get a lot more food than you actually do, and I barely saved any money compared to the usual store price. I did email TooGoodToGo about my experience but got no response (I‚Äôm not even sure they received it as the app repeatedly froze when using the ‚Äòcontact us‚Äô feature)",2,Apple,2019-02-03
Lovely way to save & eat delicious food So far we‚Äôve had a great experience using too good to go .... we love using it specially for pastries that we freeze and eat for breakfast during the week,5,Apple,2021-07-05
Reviews I have had the app a while and never really get anything worth having in my bags. Would be good if you could leave a written review for places. Let others know what was in your bag on what days and what they can expect for their money. Because I‚Äôve been left disappointed (more than once) I‚Äôm hesitant to get another bag,2,Apple,2021-10-05
Vegan All items vegan which is great as other stores are not able to make this option available. Many thanks üòä,5,Apple,2021-04-24

Morrisons Peckham Got box was good value for money for the goods that I got Only thing on the down side was most of the items were the same i e four boxes blueberrys 3 packs green beans and other items were repeated,5,Apple,2019-12-12
"Genius idea! Tried it first time yesterday and was amazed how easy and convenient it is. 

Few suggestions of how to improve the app:
If you could search veggie/vegan options or as for some people GF options in a search bar or in a filter that would be great. 
Or if you could leave a note to the store - for example there‚Äôs so many places that could be made veggie or vegan friendly if only you could leave a note ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt include meat, only veg‚Äù 

Other than that! Amazing! Five stars! üëèüèªüëçüèª",5,Apple,2019-08-27
"Ibis breakfast box - Cardiff gate First timer paid for two boxes excellent value feed four of us plus the leftovers for the milo dog!
Still warm, tasty and considering what you would have to pay if you were stayed in hotel - a bargain.
Excellent would recommend

Why Did I Not Know About This Sooner?! Such a great concept. Always exciting to see what‚Äôs in the surprise surplus bag when you pick it up. SUCH good value for money; you try new places AND you‚Äôre fighting food waste. üí™ Can‚Äôt recommend this app enough.,5,Apple,2019-03-16
"Very misleading I ordered a carvery- Meadowfarm Sheffield. I 100% understand that it is just food waste. However, I got there after the carvery had closed so all the food was going to waste. They had two full pieces of meat (enough to feed a family of 5 for at least a week). However the man handed me my box which was full of veg no meat! So all the meat will just go to waste and I have actually paid for food waste?? I will not be using this app again. Very disappointing.",1,Apple,2019-05-06
"Great value Super friendly staff, quick and easy to collect and they went out of the way to go the extra mile, Thankyou, will deffo be using again",5,Apple,2021-05-17
"Not good value As with other reviewers I bought a couple at different venues to try - same result both times. Both first visits they didn‚Äôt have any even though they said in stock. Then when I finally got them they were not up to scratch. One example - 1x semi skimmed milk, 1x bag of bagels, 1x nourishment pudding (can dented and rusty) & 1x sandwich. For ¬£3.09 I wasn‚Äôt blown away at all.",2,Apple,2021-11-13
"First time using app I used the app for the first time today. I was anxious about collecting my order incase the staff didn‚Äôt know about Too Good To Go! 

However, collection was much much easier than expected. No issues or explanation needed. 

Received a bag from Greggs and one from Cafe Nero. Got so much food for my money. So impressed with the app!

Just wish I lived in a city where there‚Äôs more choice of restaurants (but lockdown may have some impact on this)!",5,Apple,2021-03-28
"Great Staff were so kind and helpful with it being my first collection.
Thank you. I look forward to seeing you again. Thank you the kids loved the biscuits.",5,Apple,2020-09-11
"Great app- but needs more suppliers A really good idea and app, but it does need more variety of suppliers. Either a diary entry or notification of when an order is ready to collect would be a good addition.",5,Apple,2020-01-08
"Disappointing So I‚Äôve been trying to get the elusive Morrison‚Äôs magic box for weeks now, when I did finally manage to get one (I had to sit for 15 minutes refreshing my phone) it got cancelled as there wasn‚Äôt enough waste food. I know there are many people buying 3 per week but I can‚Äôt manage to get one. App is glitchy and when I emailed customer service I didn‚Äôt even get a response!",1,Apple,2020-02-11
Giving to the homeless I love this app! For me best way to give to the homeless. I just tried it for the first time and gave the spoils out to some of the rough sleepers in Hammersmith definitely going to do this more regularly. The food was hot and delicious.,5,Apple,2019-12-05
"Good value. Really good value and it‚Äôs nice to see food not wasted.
The only worry is the people who sit on their phones all day and abusing the system.
There should be a cap on how many times a week you do it so people can have a chance.",5,Apple,2019-11-09
"Great food My first go at this app and I would highly recommend it too üëç great food at a discounted price, friendly staff and quick collection overall very happy üòÅ",5,Apple,2021-11-15
"Great idea but There are several businesses near me registered on this service that never have bags available.
I‚Äôve bought bags a couple of times from other retailers but realised that the food I am buying is not particularly healthy. 
I think the concept is great but it is not quite working and I probably won‚Äôt use again.",3,Apple,2019-05-27
"Magic bag smoke and mirrors ! Got a bag from Morrison‚Äôs , most of it reduced in the day yet still hadn‚Äôt sold . In the bag was a pack of cooked chicken chunks at room temperature and swollen like it was ready to burst . I wasn‚Äôt even opening it never mind eating it .",5,Apple,2021-11-08

"Great app Really good app, excellent communication from staff, friendly and supportive. Would just like to receive notification for when good comes available. 

Thanks team!!",5,Apple,2021-03-07
Dietary options The app should allow you to at least choose a vegetarian option. I would use this app a lot more if I was sure that I could eat everything that was in the bag!,4,Apple,2021-04-08
"So glad I found this app! When I first used it I was a bit nervous that the stores would no what I was talking about. Not the case at all! All staff know that you‚Äôve ordered and with a quick show of your order on the app hand over the bag.

This week managed to nab a bag from starbucks. In my bag I got a selection of eight pastries and sweet treats all for ¬£4.50.

Hoping more stores will work with too good to go so there is more future options 

Love it!",5,Apple,2021-02-20

"Don‚Äôt get this app!!

I feel really silly when this happens and I end up wasting my time coming all the way to the place.",1,Apple,2021-03-10
"Not great for people with dietary needs Great concept. But having just signed up discover you have no control over what food you are given. This is no use for people with allergies, intolerances and on specific diets. I would use this if I was able to be sure I would receive food I will actually be able to eat, but it seems like I would end up with anything.",1,Apple,2021-01-12
Very good if you‚Äôre not fussy what you eat I love this app and use it every time I‚Äôm heading home through a big station and need something to eat. If you‚Äôre not fussy about food it‚Äôs perfect!,5,Apple,2020-02-29
"Yes to food I would love to have an option for either sweet or savory consumables. I really dont enjoy getting 50 bits of chocolate croissants when im hungry and vice versa beans when i need a treat. Since i have to pay in advance, this selection option would be grand",4,Apple,2020-02-29
Vegan Options My vegan choices have been a taste revolution and really opened up the possibility of eating without animal products and actually enjoying the food and not passing massive amounts of methane into the atmosphere after!

Eat well for cheap One of the best apps out there. Good food at a good price that would be otherwise wasted.

"Brilliant yummys Mainly I go for the food from other countries (my weak spot). I always get good portions and the people are very friendly. I do feel the food is too good to waste but I suppose that‚Äôs the reason for this app.

Such a genius idea! I love this app! Used it for the first time last night when we picked up a pizza for ¬£3.99 that would‚Äôve otherwise gone in the bin. It was delicious and we saved good food from being wasted. What‚Äôs not to love?,5,Apple,2019-04-03

Don't spend money on outdated food! I loved the idea and concept behind this app. You can buy food that would be thrown away for half the price. Except that after ordering I realised that the food I got wasn't worth what I spent and that the  food made me and my roommate sick! So save your money and instead of buying old food. Go buy fresh stuff. It ll be the same price anyway... Shame really...,1,Apple,2021-02-13

Will be ordering again soon and telling our friends",5,Apple,2019-12-08
"25% Success Rate I‚Äôve used Too Good To Go four times. First time, the restaurant had no idea what the app was or what they should do. Second, the (different) bakehouse was closed over Christmas/New Year. Third, great - no issues and great food. Fourth: travelled to the restaurant to find there was nothing left and they turned me away, advising me to contact Too Good To Go for a refund.",2,Apple,2020-02-20
"Great experience The first time using the app and a great experience. The magic box consisted of 3 cream cakes, 1 brioche bun, 1 cheese plait, 1 chicken tikka bun and a large wholemeal loaf. Amazing value and such an excellent idea all round. I just hope it goes from strength to strength.",5,Apple,2019-11-16
"Outstanding food We ordered two magic boxes, having never used the restaurant before we didn‚Äôt know what to expect 
Very happily surprised it‚Äôs was outstanding, ribs burger homemade slaw and waffles will definitely be going back",5,Apple,2019-07-28
Best App ever. It couldn‚Äôt be easier and yummier to safe food from being wasted and eating well not to mention saving money. Love it and hope for more restaurant to join. I definitely won‚Äôt look back.,5,Apple,2019-06-05
Jiffy Stratford The person behind the desk helped pick some of the freshest fruits and vegetables which I much appreciated. I would recommend going there and see to believe.,5,Apple,2021-10-28
"Great idea, not enough businesses The stuff I‚Äôve had has been fantastic so far but it‚Äôs few and far between and normally I have to drive a fair distance to pick it up during the 30 mins time slot.
If there were more local businesses getting involved I would use this all the time.",3,Apple,2018-09-23
A great experience and lovely selection I really like coming here. They‚Äôve got a lot of new and surprising things as well as new takes on old favourites,5,Apple,2021-07-30

"Wonderful!!! First time user, and collection was quick and seemless. Can‚Äôt believe the amount and great variety of food in the bag! The staff member who served me was really friendly and helpful. Thanks so much.",5,Apple,2020-08-29
Great concept that can be improved Saving food from going to waste or just picking up a bargain is a great concept. Unfortunately the app is lacking notifications when bags become available.,4,Apple,2020-11-25
"Sustainable and budget friendly I love this app, it‚Äôs sustainable and helps me be able to afford to eat as a broke uni student whose paying tuition out of pocket. The food is always delicious and the service is great.",5,Apple,2020-02-28
"AMAZING great app! Not too many places in my area on it yet but a couple lovely bakeries that always come through with some great left over food, it‚Äôs cheap, tasty and waste free what‚Äôs not to love! 10/10",5,Apple,2020-02-11
Amazing Super chuffed! Only been trying for nearly 2 weeks to get a box because they are always sold out! but amazed with box :) well worth it!,5,Apple,2020-01-04
"Love it too much One of those brilliant ideas you wish you‚Äôd come up with yourself. Great idea, GREAT food, great app - just need more vendors to sign up (and more customers too to make sure it keeps going). Yo Sushi: never stop using it please!",5,Apple,2018-03-22
"Amazing meal or bag of slop Zero quality control on the people they admit on their system. Either you get an amazing meal of left over packaged food, or it‚Äôs some random deli who rip you off. At the very least make sure you are shopping at a brand name store unless you want a sad croissant or stodgy wrap.",3,Apple,2019-11-27
"Great principle, not great for food intolerance, nothing nearby Would be better if you could select or dismiss things, like no meat, no dairy, no nuts, food intolerant vegetarian here. Veg and bread box be ok. No stores less then 10km from me, and don‚Äôt drive as disabled. Maybe it will improve in future. Idea is great, but early days yet. Needs fine tuning, maybe in time will improve.",2,Apple,2019-11-26
No way to customise Great idea but no way to customise. I‚Äôm vegetarian and while you can rock up to the place and request vegetarian magic bag there‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll have it so you end up going and not leaving with anything you can have. If there‚Äôs a way to customise that I‚Äôm missing someone let me know because I love the service!,3,Apple,2019-08-31

The order down here bit. Can you get rid of the constant Tip Your Oder are here. It‚Äôs clunky and we already know. Don‚Äôt need constant reminder and adds more steps close window then click.,4,Apple,2021-09-10
Amazing Just picked up my Waitrose magic bag. Bag was so heavy and full of a really good selection of amazing products. Will definitely order from here again! 10/10,5,Apple,2021-04-23
"Great idea, poor experience. Got one of these magic bags from a local petrol station who sell a big supermarket brand of food. The bag cost ¬£4 and when I added up the prices on the yellow stickers it was ¬£3.92. I could have walked into the shop and picked up exactly the same items for less. I know it‚Äôs not a big difference but don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking your getting a bargain!",1,Apple,2021-06-16
"Great app This is a really good app with really cheap options for lots of good food! However, it would be great to have a vegetarian or vegan option because it‚Äôs disappointing when the majority of the bag has things with meat in it.",4,Apple,2021-06-02
Order cancelled 4 minutes before collection time Paid for my magic bag the evening before. Arrived at shop for collection to see they had cancelled it in the 10 minutes it took me to leave the house and reach the shop. Total waste of time and it may take up to 10 days to refund me. A good idea but only if participating retailers play fair. I have deleted the app.,1,Apple,2021-05-26
"Karibu - my new found favourite OMG can‚Äôt believe I bought this amazing food for ¬£10. I would definitely pay full price. My mouth had a party. Burger wicked fries, gorgeous hummus and cauli side. The brownie was to die for.",5,Apple,2021-02-27

"For ¬£3 you can‚Äôt go wrong! This was my first time buying a too good to go food bag and it was not a disappointment!
In my ‚Äòmagic bag‚Äô was a beautiful HUGE mozzarella and pesto foccacia sandwich, a cheese salad croissant, a MASSIVE raisin swirl pastries and a pain au chocolat.
Thank you Well and Fed. üòä",5,Apple,2019-11-16
AMAZING! The friendliest staff member! He asked me if I had a favourite flavour and loaded up my boxes. I absolutely love Cinnabon and how amazing that I‚Äôve saved food from being wasted! Would buy again in a heartbeat!,5,Apple,2021-11-16
"No customer service - I seem to have paid for an embarrassing encounter. I‚Äôve only used this once. A week ago and am still waiting to get a reply from my multiple attempts to contact someone in customer support. The restaurant I had ordered from, when I went to collect my food, had never heard of the app so my order never existed. Still waiting for my refund. Such a shame as this seems like a good idea.",1,Apple,2019-04-16
"How I ve found magic bags Hadmagic bags  from greggs and Aston Clinton garage .excellent content s on both of these bags another from Costa coffee,only 3 items so that was a rip offer. Won‚Äôt bother with Costa coffee again.",5,Apple,2021-07-26
You just gotta look in the reviews Greggs and Cafe nero have given me lots of food but there are orhers as leon and chicken restaurants and a curry one that they just gave me rubbish. You need to know wich ones to buy,5,Apple,2021-06-29
Brilliant App Very User Friendly The service was amazing. The app is so handy to use and is such a good idea to prevent food waste and super ideal for students. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this app more!,5,Apple,2020-11-07
Impossible Tried at various times of day. Usually says sold out but today one said try later. I did every minute for 10 minutes and then it said sold out at 6.16. I‚Äôd been trying to get something for over 10 minutes. What does check back later mean?  Does it mean you are in a queue but not a snowballs chance of getting a bag?,1,Apple,2021-03-25
"Magic bag I drove a 13 mile round trip to collect this magic bag! It was definitely worth the trip. The food lovely, a good variety and still hot when I got home. Great value for money. Thanks GD Box üëçüèº",5,Apple,2020-08-07
love ! I‚Äôve used it x2 so far and both times it has been seamless !! I love the variety but also how it‚Äôs allowed me to find new business‚Äôs to support. Love it and it‚Äôs message - üíòüíò,5,Apple,2020-02-14
Excellent Very impressed with this app. Worked perfectly and I will definitely use it again. The service that I received when collecting my first order was excellent,5,Apple,2019-11-11
For vegetarians! All food was delicious you get to get the food from the counter as ima. Vegetarian I was worried what if meat was put in the container . But you get given the empty container and you get to fill it up yourself . So get to copse whatever you want ! For ¬£3.29!!! Was yummy,5,Apple,2019-09-23
"Breakfast grab and go The app is very easy to use as it shows food outlets nearby. I selected the place that was nearest to where I live, paid, collected it, took it home and ate it. What more can you ask!!? ¬£2.25 for a hot breakfast was good value.",5,Apple,2019-04-17
"Good use of food that would be wasted Just started using and have found some real good magic bags, glad I‚Äôm doing my bit to prevent food wastage.",5,Apple,2021-11-08
"Add notification of favourites!! Excellent idea & great value food that also helps prevent food waste, however I keep missing listings from my favourite places as there are no notifications or way of knowing when they will list items!",4,Apple,2018-05-26
"Terrible choice if you‚Äôre from a religious background There‚Äôs no option for having non ham types of scraps from places. So you‚Äôre given something you are not able to consume, which is a waste of money purely. Don‚Äôt use it you‚Äôre from a religious background or don‚Äôt eat things like ham as you‚Äôll end up with this in your bag 9/10 times.",1,Apple,2021-12-06
Meh Out of a couple of purchases only one was worth it. The rest contained mostly soggy old sandwiches and stale pastries. Not the best for dinner I must say. To have a preview of the content of the bag would be a big improvement. I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted time to collect something I don‚Äôt find appetising at all let alone pay for it.,2,Apple,2021-11-30
Brilliant app and scheme I‚Äôve now used the app twice to buy food from my local Co-op. Spend ¬£3.30 to get ¬£15+ of food. Very easy experience. And it‚Äôs reducing food waste. Win-win.,5,Apple,2021-10-27
"M&S Roxwell road Best value we‚Äôve had from the many TooGoodToGo, as variety and selection is a mix of sandwich box and meal deals.  Unlike some garage stores who just supply sandwiches!!",5,Apple,2021-08-13
"Mrs Pleasant    Staff , great value all food fresh eat over a few days.    Nice to try different foods.    Real bargain.   Nice to live well for a few days.  And a plus. Stop food going to waste.  Thank you.",5,Apple,2021-07-16

"Impressed with the value Good variety and excellent value. Used twice so far for Spar (turkey breast, turkey slices, large jam cake, fruit drink, garlic bread and pack biscuits) for ¬£3:50. Costa ( x2 toastie slices, ham sandwich and Salmon & cheese sandwich) for ¬£3.
Will be trying other places soon üëç",5,Apple,2021-05-11

"What a great app Well what can I say talk about non waste and getting an absolute load of food for your money I recommend this to everyone,",5,Apple,2021-01-01
"Can never get anything on this Good concept but despite having this app for several months and checking daily, I am yet to get anything. Everything sells out within seconds and the app doesn‚Äôt allow notifications to be sent so you just have to be on the app at the right time. Very frustrating. A waste of time",1,Apple,2021-02-14
Brilliant app Absolutely love the fact that food is not going to waste and people are being given the chance to buy it at a massively reduced price.,5,Apple,2019-12-10
Nothing Checked everyday in different areas and there is no wasted food anywhere so no point . Every time it‚Äôs ( no food needs saving ) ( no food needs saving & guess what still no food needs saving . Maybe there‚Äôs not as much food waste then if there‚Äôs never anything available.,2,Apple,2020-11-28
"Morrisons The morrisons from wellingborough, they put out 2 magic bags and they are giving everything they have to the first person that arrives!!

"Try it, you might like it A greater way to try something new, you might not have ordered given a choice, you might discover new favourites and help reduce waste at the same time, win winT-caddy",5,Apple,2019-10-16
Same price I just end up paying same price for for the food. We should be able to see what we are buying before the purchase looks like sellers exploding this opportunity.  I like the idea of saving food but paying same price as menu at the end of the day not acceptable.,2,Apple,2019-12-03
"Easy to use, one click payment Lots of different options, clear app of where they are and how many are left.",5,Apple,2019-08-11
"Great app Great app, easy to use, lots of local and further afield variety. Promotes saving waste and trying new things with element of surprise. Places to collect are easy to get to but times are quite specific.",5,Apple,2019-07-13
La romana First time using the app and ordered 4 magic box‚Äôs from la Romana food was beautiful and fresh as it was actually cooked in front of us definitely using the app again feed 8 ppl for less than ¬£12,5,Apple,2019-07-04
I‚Äôm confused Can you only pay with card or can you pay upon arrival at the place you are ordering from,5,Apple,2021-12-28
"Seriously disappointed I have had the same bad experience in a couple of places now. Today I finally just uninstalled the app.
Latest nightmare: I ordered 2 magic bags from Jaffa Bake House. Took a bus to get to them and they just told me they had run out. Gave me two patties and told me each was worth ¬£3. This is quite unacceptable.

Yes it‚Äôs not the app makers fault but it‚Äôs their job to educate the good places on highlighting when they are sold out.",1,Apple,2019-05-18
"5 star! Awesome app! Such a great idea; we get cheap delicious food, the restaurant gets an extra bit of cash for food that would have otherwise been thrown away, and we help to reduce food waste! We got ¬£17 worth of sushi for just ¬£3.50. Would be nice to see more restaurants in Nottingham and Derby.",4,Apple,2018-06-10

"Restaurant taking advantage of the app Efes good we wanted to save, Turkish food, you‚Äôd expect some meat or chicken or something grilled right? What we got was what tasted like warm water with tomato bits and Turkish rice in it. I am not sure that‚Äôs even on the menu or did they just create this to make some money of local university students?
Love the idea of this app but very dissatisfied and definitely won‚Äôt be using again.",1,Apple,2021-09-02
"Food waste warriors Great end of the day value for money. I am working harder than ever before as a secondary teacher during COVID, too good to go has taken the stress of cooking dinner. Thank you",5,Apple,2020-12-13
Great scheme I think this is a great scheme to reduce food waste. I‚Äôve used it to collect a couple of magic bags from Costa. The bags have included a variety of sweet and savoury goods and have been excellent value. It is a shame that there are not more outlets in my area.,4,Apple,2021-01-08
"Everyone should be doing this!!! Most restaurants are so welcoming! And they are very generous with their food! 
Plus you are doing something positive about food wasting and the planet!",5,Apple,2020-01-15
No notifications Love the app but it‚Äôs a case of striking lucky as to whether there is anything available as the notifications do not work. You have to check regularly if you are looking for a bargain. Would be so much easier if the notifications worked.,2,Apple,2020-09-26
Great Food and staff too! This was my first ever visit to the venue. The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The food is delicious and very filling. You can tell they use fresh produce by the taste. Highly recommended.,5,Apple,2019-11-30

I‚Äôd recommend this service to anyone. 
Amazing idea",5,Apple,2020-02-20
Bad value I tried this twice and was disappointed both times with the quantity / type of food. A pile of rice and 3oz of chicken for ¬£3 from Deli Fuego is bad value by any standards. And Costa‚Äôs bag was just a few cherry bakewells and a couple of tiffins. Get the distinct impression they‚Äôre not really getting rid of leftovers but fobbing punters off with as little as they can get away with. I won‚Äôt be bothering again.,1,Apple,2020-07-27
Too good to go at 1901 manors Paid ¬£3.09 and got a large bacon sandwich a large sausage sandwich which I think supposed to be ¬£4.50 each and also a very nice cake. So all in all I was impressed,5,Apple,2020-02-14
Friendly staff and tasty food Would definitely do this again as the food was very tasty - the element of surprise (not knowing exactly what you‚Äôll get) is fun too,5,Apple,2020-01-20
"1st time was a winner I decided to try the app and opted for a yo sushi for 3.50, went and picked it up and got choice of 2 sushi boxes would have got ¬£13 in total, my husband loves sushi and loves a bargain so he was very happy x",5,Apple,2020-01-06
"1Eve23 Very good idea to save on waste, I got a big box with vegetables(cauliflower, courgettes) fruit (oranges, lemons and blackberries) salad (ready made bowl) a dented tin of custard and some crackers(damaged box) i was pleased to get the box as they only do one a day.",5,Apple,2019-11-28
"To slow to load My son has had great success with this app as he works in London. Nothing near me apart from Morrisons which has just started. My problem is loading,  at 6pm my page goes blank and then doesn‚Äôt load till nearly 6.30 by then everything has gone.",2,Apple,2019-12-23
"Freeloaders eat your heart out! Wonderful idea just a shame it will be abuse by freeloaders. I know someone who stocked up on 7 meals in a day. This personal also earns ¬£550 a week.

Why should the majority of us buy a meal from a restaurant at it‚Äôs full price when a freeloader can just stock up on cheap food that‚Äôs so called going to waste. 

This app would be a fantastic idea for people like myself who would use the app to buy this food and hand it out to the homeless who are the people that need these meals. 

One other thing, if you can afford a mobile phone to add this app you can afford to buy yourself a meal. Freeloaders will ruin this idea and app.",1,Apple,2019-11-28
"Amazing taste, amazing price! Opened my mystery box to something I must say I have never eaten before but what a treat it was. Would highly recommend. Great flavours and taste, as well as top service. Cheers guys, will be back again!",5,Apple,2019-09-04
Customer service! When I‚Äôm sending email to customer service because was problem with something of course they replay in few hours but when I explained everything that I had f**ing problem and showing proofs so they don‚Äôt reply back anymore. If you don‚Äôt contact me back on email so I won‚Äôt change my review! Thank you !,1,Apple,2019-11-19
Not what it seems You have to pay in advance and if you miss the collection window due to traffic or whatever they keep your money and they bin the food. So you pay them to bin your food. Also the food is never worth the rrp. Just another app disguised as doing good but only after your money! Disgusting they keep your money when you receive nothing. Deliveroo or Glovo is the way to go!,1,Apple,2019-10-11
"Should be called TooGoodToBeTrue Wasted petrol and time driving to the restaurant, left 20 mins before it was time to collect, on arrival - 5 mins before collection time - message to say sorry we don‚Äôt actually have any food to give away tonight! Waste of time and money, oh and you don‚Äôt get a refund for several days. Who cares about wasted time and petrol too?! Should be a minimum time eg 25 mins not 5 mins as a warning!!!",1,Apple,2019-10-10
Great stuff! A big thanks to the whole team at Ibis for making me feel so welcome by being super friendly & showing how much they care about being food waste warriors. Got a proper continental breakfast and a cup of coffee!,5,Apple,2019-06-02
Awful food Terrible food from Absolutely starving and Spinata. I‚Äôve eaten in both places regularly during normal times and the food on off through this app is appalling. And to say it‚Äôs worth ¬£9 is a joke. I actually had one mouthful and left it on the counter. Disgusting. Shame really cos both can do so much better and gain more custom. Waste of ¬£2;99. Just be honest and say you‚Äôll be given the worst food we have left.,1,Apple,2019-07-25

"Too good to be true ! I thought I would try this app, so I downloaded it and went for my first order with sushi box. 
I went to pick up the order and had a bit of problem collecting it, as you have to have your phone or iPad with you at the collection point !
I got home to find out my surprise to be a disappointing surprise. 
80% of the order went straight to the bin. 

Will not gamble again with this, as there is a lot of restaurants that you can buy from at 50% discount half an hour before closing. But everything you buy will be of your choice and does not contain nasty surprises.",1,Apple,2021-06-02

"Great app just one comment Love this app, it‚Äôs very relevant and such a great idea to stop all the food wastage. 
Only thing I would suggest is making the food collection easier by the vendor not needing my phone to do it.",5,Apple,2019-03-12

"Not impressed I have tried this app on three different occasions now and each time have had the same outcome. I am not sure if this is a problem with my local area or a more widespread issue.

Upon arrival at the shop / restaurant I am told they have insufficient surplus stock to carry out my order and offer me a refund.

What confuses me is how can this be? Surely the stores must tell the app how many bags they have available or is this done in advance by an algorithm?

I will keep it for now as I love the concept and have a few more local restaurants to try it with, but my experience so far has been negative.",1,Apple,2021-07-22

Love this app! This is an excellent initiative and we love regularly collecting food from our local bakery. One thing that stops it getting 5 stars is the length of time it takes to load locations on the map view.,4,Apple,2019-10-27
Definitely far To good to go! First time we used this app and so pleased. The bakery is artisan and bakes everything from scratch. The quantity in the magic bag and the quality were superb. Thank you!,5,Apple,2019-10-05

Life changer Fantastic app for a great cause. Highly recommended especially for those who find it hard to eat healthily in an expensive city such as London (I‚Äôm thinking of you fellow students!),5,Apple,2019-05-07
"Falls well short I used this app for a few days and found it to be incredibly disappointing. The experience of the app is really disengaging, it's unclear what you're signing up for. 

They haven't communicated with shops properly so sometimes found that the thing I'd paid for wasn't available, that I had wasted a trip, and had to email to get a refund.

On another occasion, I forgot to pick up an order. It's quite bizarre but the app doesn't remind you to pick up your order during your allotted time slot and if you forget it, you lose it. It was after that that I deleted the app.

I received a very dismissive reply from customer support in reply",1,Apple,2019-01-29
"Not worth the money I used for the first time. I‚Äôve paid ¬£2,59 for a wide range of cake and pastries and I‚Äôve got 2 small croissants, which I could have bought from the supermarket and have saved some pennies specially time. I felt I was begging for food, I just thought it would be a good idea to save a possible waste of food and make the kids happy! But no, it‚Äôs just a waste of money. I‚Äôd never use this app again.",1,Apple,2018-09-25

Not suitable for vegetarians I wish this app had an option to request vegetarian bags.

The whole point of this is to cut down food waste but If a vegetarian uses this and has meat items in the goodybag then it‚Äôll have to go in the bin anyway. 

Good idea but fails to cater to the most basic options",1,Apple,2021-02-20

I emailed to complain- never received a response.",2,Apple,2019-06-03
"Good idea but... I applaud the concept as it is brilliant. Food didn't ought to be thrown out! 

That said, I live in a newly renovated town, I can walk to Gourmet Burger, Patisserie Valerie, Pizza Express, Las Iguanas, Nandos, Carluccios... And more that I can't remember.

The service is very good however the app doesn‚Äôt always work well. 

The most frustrating problem is that you cannot copy the description of the offer... I don‚Äôt know if this is a design decision, but being 10 years in the past is never a good design decision. Ideally you would have an integration with google to handle in-app translations.

"1st collection (impressed) I‚Äôve just collected my 1st magic bag after waiting 2 weeks to finally get one! 
So the reason I haven‚Äôt given 5 stars is due to not many places in my area offering the magic bag and the ones that do always sell out super quick or have nothing left...which I know isn‚Äôt the company fault and is a good thing in a way. It‚Äôs more just frustrating, there must be a way to get more places to join too good to go. It‚Äôs also hard for families to do, that don‚Äôt have a car luckily I do so I can just set off to town or wherever in the evening to collect. Anyways...
I finally managed to get a cafe Nero bag that I‚Äôve been after for the past 2 weeks being a coffee shop fan also. It says the bag it worth ¬£10 so was expecting maybe a sandwich, bun and sausage roll or something like that as coffee shops tend to charge about ¬£4+ for most things. Well I was pleasantly surprised, when the woman handed me the bag it was overflowing I was so eager to see what was inside but still wasn‚Äôt expecting much as it looked like a lot of packaging. On opening there was a paper bag containing a pain au chocolat a cinnamon swirl, under that was a chicken Cesar wrap and a egg, bacon and sausage panini then in a box under that was a giant couscous salad thing (very yummy) then a box with 2 slices of gingerbread loaf thing that was a bit like carrot cake which was delicious. I‚Äôve had my tea then that‚Äôs breakfast and lunch sorted for the following day. All still perfect as you would get if you ordered in store. Would have been perfect for lunch or dinner for a small family and still had a day left in it all so a good way to prepare for the next day. And great for just me ¬£3 for basically 3 meals. Super value!

This email is regarding your order from Chelow BBQ on 2021-12-28. Chelow BBQ didn't have enough surplus food available and therefore had to cancel your order. We're really sorry for the inconvenience and we hope you find another Surprise Bag you like. (On the bright side, no food was wasted!)

"bad experiences I used togoodtogo 4-5 times this summer.
one of them was a bio market in Dortmund where I got 4 slices of some stale bread and one incredibly stale some kind of cookie. the cookie was so hard, I could hit people with that cookie. I paid 3,5 euros for this.
another one was a bakery in D√ºsseldorf, which gave me like 10-15 wei√ü ‚ÄãBr√∂tchen for 4 Euros and the bread rolls were also stale and very very hard. I could only eat them with hot soup.
then I decided to go for it only for Starbucks. the first one I got was ok. I got 2 sandwiches and one dessert for 4 Euros. the second time, I got the same amount but the barista treated me like some kind of homeless person. he was so sassy the whole time and he talked to me very loud in front of other people and I felt like I was some kind of begger who begs for getting those stale sandwiches for free and people were judging me. 
and the last one (I don't know why I tried once again) was also at Starbucks and I got a surprisingly small packet. inside, there were 1 and half (one of the cookies were half!!) cookies and one suspicious muffin, that's it. and this was supposed to worth 12 euros.. then I checked the prices and talked to the Barista and asked him why the girl before me got a huge bag and I got a handful of stale cookies. he said, they're just giving what they have. but then he said he could maybe give me a sandwich and he touched all the sandwiches to find the most stale one and gave it to me. I was sooo emberassed. I turned into red and went back home. and I will never use toogoodtogo ever again.
if the service were free, it'd be ok but if people are paying 3,5 or 4 euros each time, you have to give these people something enjoyable. the idea is great but it just doesn't work this way. people, just buy your food or bread from Aldi or Lidl. it's the same price and at least it's fresh and nobody makes you feel like a begger..",2,Trustpilot,2021-12-25

Greggs is by far the best place to go.

"An Excellent Idea Often Poorly Executed By Participating Suppliers... I've had good and bad experiences after using the app' for 6 months or so. Today my Magic Bag was incredibly stingy, but that's not a first. I complained in the store and got a muffin thrown in with my budget range egg mayo sandwich and solitary almond slice.
My main issues are two fold; the lack of response or a refund from TGTG when there's a problem reported and the inconsistency of the suppliers. One Costa Coffee can be massively generous, another just around the corner can be so tight they squeak when they walk (tonight's experience). So far I've found that the smaller, independent cafes and delis are the most generous overall, but not always. There needs to be some kind of enforceable minimum standard so that we can trust this app more. I don't use TGTG to save waste, I use it because I'm poor.

UPDATE - App now deleted after the most woeful magic bag today from The Soho Coffee Company. Luckily I popped into my local supermarket on the way home and bagged a ton of reduced stuff at bargain prices. 2 x quiche Lorraine's for 69p each, 2 x steak pukka pies for 49p each, 4 pints of milk for 60p, now that's magic, far more generous and still cheaper than the ¬£3.95 'tragic bag' !",2,Trustpilot,2021-11-26

Definitely not worth the effort Definitely not worth the effort. In my experience I have ordered twice on Morrisons. The first time the order was cancelled within 5 minutes of ordering despite two bags still showing available. The following day I reserved a bag at lunch time with the app showing five bags available. Email advised collection between 8pm - 9pm. At 8.05pm I arrived at the store and opened the app to find the order had been cancelled 20 minutes previous. When I asked in store they had only managed to fill three bags so none available. I have also tried Little M&S at a garage and when I arrived to collect that bag there were none left. The assistant quickly threw a bag together of reduced items still on the shelf but certainly not worth while. On the whole very disappointing and not worth my time.,1,Trustpilot,2021-11-24

"Usually not worth the money and time Time and time again I try a new restaurant, expecting a minimum value of $12 (priced at $4) or $15 (priced at $5) only to get something which I expect is valued at less than half of the advertised ""minimum"" value.  Today, I was expecting at least $15 worth of Chinese food and received a vegetarian lunch special of eggplant in sauce.   Worthless.   Not only was this a small portion, there was no nutritional value.   Eggplant alone is not highly nutritious.    There was no protein.   In the past, other restaurants have thrown together whatever junk they have around without any eye toward the minimum value.   Once, when I was expecting $15 worth of food and received a container combining french fries and fried rice, both cooked many hours earlier and nearly inedible, certainly not worth $15 if they were cooked to order.  My problem with Too Good To Go is that they use their customers as their quality control representatives and do not seem to go out and check to see what restaurants are giving out.   They only respond to complaints, where they really need to be proactive.

Some merchants are really decent, but the ones that take advantage of people's desire to do just a little good and get a decent deal should be flagged.

1. Manage your expectations - you can't rely 100% that you will get what you hope for (or anything at all) - this is about food waste, and if there is no waste, you should accept that.
2. Don't travel too far for it - consider the time and money it takes to collect your food, it may not be worth the effort.
3. Look at the ratings - if previous customers have rated low, take that into account.
4. Check the app regularly - if you are invested in a particular meal adventure, be prepared to refresh the app often, as there is no guarantee when they may pop up.

It's a great concept but the few ""magic bags"" available from decent sellers tend to sell out immediately and even those businesses are unreliable in terms of cancelations. Hopefully, this app will be developed and more businesses will participate in the future but at the moment the app is dead most of the time except for a handful of semi-rural pubs selling leftover carveries, garages selling tired sandwiches, or supermarkets selling already discounted items.

I should add that if you buy a magic bag from a supermarket then not only do you get items that had already been discounted, but their value rarely adds up to what you pay once the discount is taken into account! It would literally be better to go to the same supermarket in the evening and buy the same discounted produce in the fridge. Not only would you get to chose but you would get more goods for less. The only businesses that are worth it for this app are cafes like Starbucks and Costa that sell fresh cakes, etc., that wouldn't ordinarily get discounted in the evening. Don't bother with the supermarkets, they are pretty much running a scam.",1,Trustpilot,2021-10-29

Oversalted french fries, dry are not, what we are aiming for - they SHOULD go!
If the place ( here I am talking about Burger King ) has plenty of customers and is still for a longer while open after collection, they cannot offer things ""to good to go"", - because they would not go, if they are ""OK"", they rather would be sold normally.
So the conclusion is:  
They use this idea to do advertisements, earn at least a certain amount, if they collect, what they prepared and could not sell at this moment, so they lost in quality and are put into 'magic bags' - that's not OK!!

"Mixed experience and getting fed up of wasted journeys Mixed experience. Only a few bags available in my area. When I have managed to collect one they have been good and worth it - Greggs, Costa, Anoki. However, I've also bought 3 which haven't been there when I went to collect. This wastes my time and fuel defeating the eco friendly aims of the company. Why can't they cancel the order once they realise there isn't enough for a bag?

I even took a bag back because it was so bad. Still waiting for a refund. Absolutely horrendous company! It's a con.

Pack of Flame grilled Chicken..93p

There was a reduced  cabinet full of nice reduced stuff..Cauliflower and other veg, cakes...prawns and Sausages.. bread and crumpets.. I would of preferred those items, 
The Pizzas are just coop plain margherita,
 and the Ham is all brown looking on the edges..a bit pink in middle layers and top. opend the small box of chicken..smells a bit too sweet for flamed grilled..but probably OK.
I do buy reduced items sometimes but I would not ever buy brown rimmed Ham or soggy floppy sandwiches so why put them in the box?
I wont be buying again..
Too good to go..needs to check the quality of items going into the box/bags because I think.. I paid for reduced stuff at reduced prices for the value of ¬£4.00 NOT ¬£12.00..Where is the bargains in that?

I would order 2-3 times a week from my local shops. In the beginning it was mostly sandwiches, rolls and the odd sweet treat. Now it has changed to include mostly sweet treats that are really off tasting, over cooked bakes (apart from sausage rolls that are quite nice) and the odd sandwich/rolls. Ended up throwing one bag completely as it was packed with sugar donuts and vegan ham &  cheese baguettes which we fed the birds. Morrisons magic bag was hit and miss on the two occasions I ordered. One was full of still fresh fruit and veg but the other put me off by hiding rotten food at the bottom and bulking with cheap white bread.

However, my experience with the Customer Service team when I raised this was great and they refunded me the very next day, so hats off! Out of principle I would never order one from a supermarket as it seems more likely you'll get ""worse"" food and it'll end up just being rubbish odds and ends rather than anything good.

"I dont want to lose self respect from owners/servers though we help them to save their food waste When I started with this app, I really loved how it worked and really excited. I made some purchases but I felt the treatment given by restaurant owners/servers is not fair. They don't acknowledge you as a customer but look at you like a homeless or second-class buyer. At first, I thought maybe its how I feel and not their intention. I made another purchase recently, the server threw some crappy food and ignored our order (even though the owner said to her the food is not enough for one plate). As a customer, we could not ask them for good customer service because its a bargain purchase from ""too good to go app."" We left with no choice but to just take whatever food and service offered. I advertised about the app on youtube and other social platforms initially but now I feel its not worth it. Though the values of the app is great and important for this world, it is not being executed properly by the vendors.

No. Would I have bought a chicken sandwich that needs eating today. No not at 20:15. That leaves a punnet of strawberries, 2 stale white rolls and a swede. 
I have complained to the shop about the poor selection. The shop said it was too add up to the ¬£10. It doesn't and not the price paid.

"I really wouldn‚Äôt buy from here‚Ä¶ I really wouldn‚Äôt buy from here anymore. I‚Äôve tried twice once at a local bakery and then at Costa. Both times I have felt like a second class person walking in for some ‚Äòfree food‚Äô. There is no acknowledgement of the fact that you have paid for your food. The workers at the restaurants don‚Äôt care and are not behind the scheme of reducing food waste. They are very stingy and in fact give you the worst stale food which no one is going to eat. This is not tackling food waste. It more feels like they have signed up to gain extra customers and a few extra cash from customers who would otherwise not have dropped into the store that day. 

Whilst the idea behind the app was good, the values are not translated by businesses that take part in this schemes. Further if you are really tackling food waste you should not be charging customers for this esp if the food quality is going to be awful. 

The Costa I went into recently, I showed the app code to claim my bag. There was an Indian lady at the counter. I saw her literally put in an egg sandwich in there the cost of which in full price was less than how much I paid on too good to go.

"Love My Mystery Bag, Choose Expensive Places for Leftovers I just ordered my first ""Too Good to Go"" mystery bag and it was awesome. I saw that a nearby bakery was offering a bag at 3 p.m. not far from my house. It had good reviews on Yelp for its regular menu and I put in my order. It said three bags were available and I snagged the last one. At 3 p.m. on the dot, I showed up. The guy behind the counter didn't have the bag ready for me but filled it up while I was waiting. He grabbed dozens of bagels that were still being offered for sale at the regular price!! I wondered what the other customers thought when he handed me a huge bag of them as if I were a relative of the store's owner! I was lucky I had a reusable shopping tote to carry it all home. I paid only $5 and had to freeze most of it because it was so much food.

I think the app works really well, you just have to vet your store/restaurant/cafe carefully. It seems like the bad reviews are from people ordering leftovers from local stores that didn't offer high quality food to begin with. I'd skip a bodega in the Bronx, for example. If their food was generally cheap or affordable at the ""normal"" price, don't expect them to be too generous as their margins are thin.

Here's my advice:
If you can, choose an eatery from a wealthy, food-snob neighborhood. They will have better food because the minute anything is less than perfect, they have to throw it out as they know their patrons will turn up their noses at it. I once had a spendthrift friend who pathetically mimicked the habits of the rich and would toss out a perfectly good tomato if it had a tiny blemish. What's garbage to a perfectionistic wealthy food snob is gourmet to a working class person. I would also read the Yelp reviews for that business to see if they serve good food regularly.

Next, choose the time carefully. I'd get there as close to the pickup time as possible to avoid getting stuck with the leftovers of the leftovers. I like midday or early afternoon bags from a diner or bakery because it's clearly leftovers from the ""breakfast rush hour."" There's also less competition since fewer people can run out to a place during working hours (I work from home so it doesn't matter, LOL). The after-hours leftovers (from 9 p.m. onward) are probably good too because it's food from dinners that couldn't be sold. If you're a night owl, you may score a feast as some places offer bags at midnight to 1 a.m.(!) when they close. I don't know if I'd want to go out that late, but if you're a night owl, why not?

I'd avoid grocery ""mystery bags"" because most are probably poor in quality. I saw my local Korean owned grocery store on the list and recalled they had not-so-nice produce even at the normal price - I shudder to think what they'd put in a ""magic"" bag. However, I would make an exception for a ""gourmet"" supermarket - I'd love to get a Whole Foods mystery bag! This goes back to my first piece of advice: the more expensive and higher quality the eatery, the better the leftovers.

Also get mystery bags from areas that's known for a being a foodie destination. If there's an area with lots of restaurants, the food will be of higher quality even if it's cheap due to so much competition. I have a friend who lives in Astoria and I am jealous of all the great food she gets to bag home thanks to the app.

Since it's a new app, new places are getting added to the list all the time. I think I'll continue using it and having fun checking out these cheap eats while saving food from the dumpster.",5,Trustpilot,2021-07-16

His colleague replaced these items, with some expiring today: A moldy quiche, this meat stuff that was clearly browned up and I would not trust it (it was pink on the side where it was touching the plastic, only the edges were brown), burrata cheese and shawarma pieces I think are ok (look ok, didn't open them yet), but the pickup is 19:00-19:45, who the floof eats that late? Clearly just the store caring to moneygrab less than 1 hour before closing. Funny, because Ekoplaza is all about ""biological healthy eating"" bs. This app also opened my eyes to not shop here anymore.
4. Le Perron (bakery) Bussum Tomorrow - see edit on the bottom.

I have contacted the staff from the app and hopefully I can at least get a partial refund, as these items cost me 5‚Ç¨ ... for one cheese and one shawarma! Could have gotten those items for the same price but actually fresh! It wasn't even a little bit of mould on that quiche, it was so much I whopping mistook it for spinach!!!!

Depending on the outcome and tomorrow's pickup I'll change my review. I am NOT happy so far.

Edit: Le Perron gave me great amount of bread for great price. The Ekoplaza Shawarma turned out to be edible, but the cheese wasn't, oh boy did I gag. They refunded the Ekoplaza order.

I think this app is good, but AVOID chains like Ekoplaza, or any non-small business, because the big fishes don't care about small people, only about their pockets, even if it's an extra 5‚Ç¨.",4,Trustpilot,2021-06-26

"Horrible experience at Costa Coffee I ordered a magic bag from Costa Coffee -  Uxbridge The Mall 10 days back.  When I went to collect it, the lady at the counter was very rude and said that she had no more magic bags as they had run out and she did nothing more to help. So I asked to speak to the manager as I had already paid for it and their system should show that its due for collection. The manager then asked her to prepare a bag for me.  When I got home I realised that all they had put in was 1 croissant, 1 vegetable sandwich with a half price sticker on it and 1 ham sandwich also with a half price sticker. This was nowhere close to ¬£10. I went back to tell them that I was appalled at the contents of the bag, to which the same lady now apologised and said that she had forgotten to put a muffin in the bag; and she handed me one repeating that they had run out and this was all she had to give. This was a frustrating and embarrassing experience as they should not have even accepted the order in the first place if they had run out of food. Secondly, knowing that a magic bag was booked, they should have kept it ready before the food ran out rather than being rude about it. Needless to say, I will not go back to Costa.",1,Trustpilot,2021-06-21

Everything in the bag was either use by 2nd or best before 2nd. I immediately contacted Too Good to Go to report this and have heard nothing back. I also contacted Spar and have yet to receive a response. It is illegal to sell or give away food which is past its use by date, carrying significant fines if found guilty.

"Great idea, poor execution Really disappointing experience at BP garage Leatherhead considering this was the first time I have used the app and had been excited about the grocery bag I would receive. 

Upon opening I found 4 salads and some chips, all of which had been reduced with the total value being ¬£5, I'd paid ¬£4, so really I'd only saved a ¬£1 on items I didn't really want, I went back into the store to query this as the value on the app stated ¬£12, I was told this was based on the original price only and that they could only make up the bags to the value of ¬£12

However when calculating the original prices when I got home, it still only totalled ¬£8, which is frustrating as there were several reduced items still available that could have been added 

I think the idea is a great way to save on waste, however I feel customers will not appreciate feeling cheated which leaves a bad taste in one's mouth as you'd just be better off purchasing reduced items you actually want

I can't help but think the management are encouraging staff to pack items they know will not be purchased but keep back reduced items that will

I feel really sorry for any families who are struggling and use this app to help, only to find themselves with such disappointing items, and actually worse off

"Great, trustworthy app The company Too Good to go are brilliant and resolved my. Problem and gave me a refund within days... The companies that use the service vary - Morrisons which used to be really good (if you were lucky enough to get one) are now terrible. Very out of date food, sometimes mouldy, opened packets, basically anything which they cannot (and would not be allowed to) sell. Very disappointing.

Greggs is good. Costa is not worth it at all imo.",5,Trustpilot,2021-05-20

"Horrible. Cancelled order and took my money Horrible. Paid close to $40 for 2 orders and when I arrived to collect them, after walking over a mile, they had been canceled by the store after the store after the pickup window began. Now,  I have to wait 3-5 business days for a refund, was inconvenienced by traveling over 2 miles round trip on foot, and all TooGoodToGo could manage was a form letter in response to my complaint.",1,Trustpilot,2021-05-19
"Will be deleting app Update: So I tried Caff√® Nero and lolas cupcakes and got 3 pastries from Caff√® Nero, two being the same. Not impressed...and I was the only bag ready to collect just like at Greggs so I reckon the app puts up and takes down the listings to make it look like there‚Äôs demand. Won‚Äôt be using again as it‚Äôs cheaper to just look for clearance items.

The problem with this app is that you have to check it VERY regularly if you're wanting to catch any half decent places. I managed to get a Greggs deal which for ¬£2.59 I guess is good if you're happy with whatever. I got a 4 pack of iced ring donuts, a box of 2 yum yums, a steak bake and another savoury pastry. I was hoping more for sandwiches or savoury bits, but that's the mystery of it I guess.
Reading other people's comments before choosing places to order I will always make sure the place I reserve is very close by as I've read so many reviews of places cancelling at the last moment, so I wouldn't want to have travelled to a place and wasted my time and money on it!
Regarding the supermarket places I can only imagine the monstrosity I would get, so in my opinion it's just easier for me to catch their reducing food times for better bargains.",1,Trustpilot,2021-05-18

Highly recommend, especially if you are not too fussy with food since you do not get to choose exactly what food you are given, since it is based on saving food that is left at the end of the day.

The fat Indian Romford takeaway scam Please never order from 'the fat Indian' takeaway in Romford from this app. They are advertising bags worth twelve pounds and when you arrive are cooking a rice and two onion bhajis that are the exact price the bag is.

They were rude and dismissive and told me I'd have to contact TGTG for a refund.  They didn't cancel my order until after 5 min after I left.  

If TGTG supports this type of business then I will stop using it.  The whole point is that there IS something to reserve and therefore I can rely on getting it.  If it's going to be inconsistent in reliability then no point in using it.  Cafes that deliberately and repeatedly abuse the cancellation policy, as the one I visited last night did, should be banned from being on the app, they are dragging down the whole community.  

Also why can't I rate the cafe on the app for their performance, even though I didn't get to try to food?  Then at least I could judge whether to reserve a bag from a specific cafe based on how likely it was I would not waste a trip and end up with no food.",2,Trustpilot,2021-05-01

I got a few slices of pizza that most certainly were NOT worth $12.99.

For example, I had a chicken wrap made in front of me but the guy did not ask if I wanted the sauce or not. At that moment it doesn't hurt to ask as it may make my experience of their food more pleasant.

The guy put chilli sauce and all the spice when it easily could have been avoided.

"This is good! This is, as you can guess, a bit of a lucky dip.  But- and this important-check the ratings of the place you go to.

Morrisons got a very good Easter bag, not managed to get a regular one.  Costa-¬£10 value ¬£3ish cost will mean 3 items.   My advice-try the small businesses if you can, discovered some real gems that I try to shop at full price too when I can. Even the ratings between M&S garages can differ so choose wisely.

A local deli was a great find as it introduced me to a place I wouldn‚Äôt have tried & now buy from there directly as they no longer use the app & am happy to pay full price as the food is so good.

"Too Good To Go = GREENWASHING Your response to my review achieves something that I imagine most businesses look for when making claims based on flimsy evidence - it gives you plausible deniability. The magic bag system is structured so that you can respond to accusations like mine by pointing out that stores are able to adjust their sales according to how much food they have left over, without addressing whether or not this actually happens. 

Yes, it‚Äôs possible, theoretically, that Too Good To Go could reduce food waste via its magic bags, but if this were true then each store on your platform would be adjusting the number of bags they sell almost every day. So, does this happen? 

This, in fact, leads to an even more pressing question: if you accept (and apparently you do) that businesses waste varying amounts of food every day, and if you‚Äôre happy for them to adjust the amount of food they sell, then why ask them to sell this food in advance? Why compel businesses to commit to selling a set number of magic bags each day when you know that on some days there will be lots of surplus food and some days there will be none?

In other words, what is the environmental case for the magic bag model? 

After all, your stated mission is to reduce food waste, so you should have a very good answer for why the system you've adopted is the best possible system for achieving this. And I‚Äôm not being facetious here - I'm genuinely interested to hear how you can support the claim that you're able to save more food from the bin if you sell it a day in advance, rather than selling it an hour before the store closes when you know exactly what food, and how much of it, is left over.

Economically, your model makes total sense to me. If you were to stop selling the food so far in advance then the amount of food available, and therefore TGTG‚Äôs commission on sales, would be extremely difficult to predict, and predictable revenue streams are vitally important for businesses. There would also (shock horror!) be lots of days when businesses would sell either very few or zero magic bags, and therefore your income would drop, possibly dramatically. 

And given that you referenced the onboarding process and working with businesses to make sure the projected surplus levels are accurate, I should mention that friends of mine who use TGTG tell me that your salespeople are frequently in touch to encourage them to increase the number of bags they sell. 

How do you explain this? What‚Äôs the environmental case for asking businesses to waste more food? 

You claim that the onboarding process is so thorough that businesses are able to predict, with remarkable accuracy, how much food they‚Äôll have left over every day forever more, right? So why do you get it wrong so often? Why do you always underestimate? 

The answer, I suspect, is that you don‚Äôt underestimate, and the motivation behind your constant upselling has nothing to do with sustainability and everything to do with economics.  TGTG receive money each time a bag is sold, so you have a vested interest in increasing the number of bags available for sale. You don‚Äôt get paid less if the food you‚Äôre selling isn‚Äôt actually surplus, which means you naturally don‚Äôt care whether the food is surplus or not. 

Oh, and as for B Corp, they‚Äôre doing exactly what you pay them for, which is to give you a pillar to hide behind when someone points out your ethical flaws. I don‚Äôt have a problem with B Corp per se, but it‚Äôs worth noting that a) lots of B Corps have been caught doing shady things before, during, and after being registered as B Corps (it takes 30 seconds to find dozens of examples of unscrupulous B Corps), and b) B Corp aren‚Äôt experts on the food industry, so they‚Äôre not equipped to interrogate your system. 

The B Corp registration process relies on businesses being candid about their policies and practices. TGTG have shown a willingness to mislead millions of people on a daily basis as a matter of course, so there‚Äôs little reason to believe that you suddenly became honest when B Corp came knocking. 

Finally (phew!), you should really stop telling people that your app is just one way that you‚Äôre addressing the problem. The restaurants I operated ran community fundraisers, made meals for charity, and gave training to homeless people to help them find work in kitchens, but we didn‚Äôt go around telling everyone that being a restaurant was only a small part of our true function as some sort of local nirvana sent to deliver our community from unemployment and poverty. We were a restaurant, and we did some good things where we could. You are a food resale app, and you have some CSR activity.

"Catastrophic customer support Sometimes you can get a good offer but very often the stores are not honest. Very often the store will give you food of low quality or the user will get very little amount of food which is much less than the value of food you should get. 
In the app the user has the option to contact the customer support and to report the issue. And I have to say that customer support works very bad. They are very bureaucratic, not objective and never help customers.  Even if you send them the photos of the food where it is clear that the portion you got was very small, they will simply ignore it and if you insist on getting the answer, they will say that ""they are not able to determine the amount of food based on the photos that have been sent"". It is just a ridiculous reply. 
Also, you have to wait 3-4 days to get a formal reply from them.

From my local BP/M&S managed to get two pre-prepared salads with prawn cocktail and also one with new potato, egg and cherry tomato, cheesy garlic bread, a bag of salad, a lemon mousse and a pack of hot cross buns. All were still good and fresh the next day.

Costa cancelled my first a few hours before pickup - no issues, food sells y'know!

Greggs was the same experience as Costa, but the value for money was far greater. They were new, I might have been the 1st pickup at this store, so the value may come down as they calibrate their bags. But the food was great - 2 x sandwiches, bake, doughnut and 2 x yum yums.
All pickups were seamless, and I was in and out of the stores in less than a minute.  

The app: 
The app itself is easy to use and whilst I agree that the bags sometimes disappear as quickly as they appear, it is apparent with most shops what time they usually add bags to the site, but it is a bit of a lottery.
The one thing I would change is the notifications (this might be a me problem though that I'm not receiving them). It would be nice to get notifications when stores on your favourites list posts a bag. Outside of the regular posting times, I've noticed a couple of short notice bags pop on to the app for collection within the next couple of hours and it would be good to be notified of these.
Great app though and great cause.

Edit to add: Greggs added to app, added my experience with them",5,Trustpilot,2021-03-08
"It used to be better This app used to be amazing but now any time I use it, it goes from ""come back later"" to sold out in the second it takes to refresh the page. But if I don't refresh it, it still says come back soon. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it, I've tried restarting my phone in case it was a problem with my phone. I'm tempted to delete it because the objective of the app is great but the fact I'm missing out on so many opportunities because its not showing me when it's available anymore.

"Winning a Magic bag does not mean you have your food! I joined the Too Good to Go app as a way of securing decent food on the way to my emergency ambulance night shifts. It can make big difference to a long shift to have a few snacks available without having to literally lose sleep during the day. Local shops  were initially good, providing a decent selection, but something appears to have changed and 3 times now I have ""won"" magic bags only for them to be cancelled at sometimes extremely short notice after I have left or even arrived at the pickup point. This means that I still have to shop as per normal in case my ""winnings"" are cancelled.... So what is the point? Previous complaints were well handled but only with a voucher for another free MAGIC bag which you still have to ""win""... or NOT!!
As many others have noted, you can be waiting for bags to become available only to see it become ""sold out"" before any other notification, so was it really available in the first place?! I agree with the idea of reducing food waste, but you cannot rely on this app to feed you even if you ""win"" so you need to be aware of this.",1,Trustpilot,2021-03-06

"Placing orders, not saving food waste Local Gregg's at a service station in the middle of nowhere has gone from 4 bags of waste food to 10+ bags a day. First bag I received full up, all previous bags getting less and less, it's almost like I'm just placing an order for food now and not saving food from being thrown away.

EDIT UPDATE* my local service greggs still have over 10 bags a day from 4 bags a day, i tried again and received 3 items in the bag, there was a massive line of bags to go, along the counter top?
This proves it's a money maker for 2good2go as more bags means more for them. Your not saving the planet, your just lining 2good2go's pockets, mis selling with false information.
Greggs didnt sell out of magic bags until 40 minutes before closing time today(24/03/21)previously when only 4 bags they were sold out 2 hours after being released on the app. It's dodgy as you like, they'll give you a big first bag and then just put you in a big que of people actually paying for rubbish, it's a con",1,Trustpilot,2021-03-02

"Fantastic! New to this, but thoroughly impressed!! Really impressed by this service! 

-Great selection of food outlets 
-User friendly app
-Great prices 

At first I was sceptical thinking it would be a tiny bag consisting of near enough stale goods or really bizarre foods that companies just wanted to get rid of, but thought I'd give it a whirl none the less.

I'm so glad I did!! My first purchase was from my local Costa Coffee shop, a magic bag consisting of: 2 paninis ; 1 blueberry muffin ; 1 twin pack of mini cherry bakewells... Retail price around ¬£12 but my purchase price was just ¬£3... All still really fresh, and easy to replicate paninis at home in a George foreman or similar! 

My second purchase was from my local holiday inn, as a breakfast item, I was sceptical as to what this would be so bought purely through curiosity! It didn't dissapoint at all and will definitely be going back!! I was given a takeaway container with a pack of cutlery and napkin with a cooked breakfast, all really fresh as though it had been made to order and very generous portions! 3 good quality sausages, 4 rashers of bacon, 3 hashbrown bites, 3 large scoops each of: baked beans, mushrooms and scrambled egg! Having payed just ¬£3.59 for a breakfast I'd normally and happily pay upwards of ¬£8 for this was a really good quality bargain!

"Great idea, just poorly executed. The idea of an app where you can get food that's going to waste for a very low price sounds great...However,...most of the shops on the store will give you really bad stuff for the price you are paying!

I tried a bakery, and i got 2x500g bread, 2x buns with sugar on top, and a donut... and everything was so dry... I tried my best to eat it and share it with my neighbors and ended up with a bad case of... ""stomach upset"". Everything was about a 3 pounds. But if I went to tesco and bought fresher stuff from their bakery it would have been the same price...

So no, avoid this. Sorry, it really feels like you have to pay extra just to get food that should be thrown... I really do not recommend getting food from the app. And if you do, do it at your own risk.

On a side note, one of my neighbor works at LIDL and brings and shares ""food and drinks that is a day after expiry date, like really cool stuff such as maltesers chocolates, vegan stuff,etc... Wish some day we could get such products from another app or something instead of a ""magic box"" with dry bread that cost more than fresh food!",1,Trustpilot,2021-02-12
"Pro's and cons to it So far I have had two purchases from this app. One ""Too good to go"" bag was from Costa. We paid ¬£3 and received 1 bacon bap, 1 cheese and tomato toasty and 1 cheese and bean toasty. Obviously all the food expires that day and we collected around 15:00. I ate the bacon bap but neither me or my partner liked the look of the others so we offered them to our neighbours and they accepted them, so nothing went to waste.

Our second purchase was to a local business who appears to be using the app for a promotion type thing, so he sells freshly made food cheaper on the app occasionally and simply asks that we share it on social media which is fine. The food there was nice (although we did have to wait in the rain at 9pm for about 15 minutes whilst it was being made)

However, I do want to point out that it is a little frustrating because I feel as if it is the same people always getting the same stuff each week. I only say this because, for example, Greggs and Morrisons sell out INSTANTLY. I feel like people who use the app regularly know exactly what minute(!) to look at the app and order. I'd really wanted to try and get a Morrisons one to try and I noticed that they always got sold out at a certain hour and minute, so I set multiple 30 second timers a few minutes before that exact minute (yes I am super sad) to try and get one, as I have never had one and wanted to see if they were worth it, and I kid you not, I checked every 30 second (or less!) for about 4 minutes and genuinely within a 30 second gap of me not being on the app, Morrisons had listed their bags and sold out by the time I went back on in 30 seconds. I was pretty annoyed. The same happens with Greggs in that it sells out instantly(!) and I really want to try that one too - but never can. 

Budgens ones always seem to be available, but I have booked two collections with Budgens and both of them have been cancelled that day so I have never actually got anything from there.

I think it would be helpful to have notifications about food once it is released as I genuinely try and check the app so much but I am still always missing stuff all the time! It goes ridiculously quickly. I do have the notifications tab selected but it doesn't say when food is posted.

It is worth noting that you are able to cancel any purchase for a full refund up to 2 hours before collection starts, and you get a refund when the store cancels also.",3,Trustpilot,2021-02-12

"Not so magic, more like tragic bags! My teenage Son is creating a project for school on food waste in the UK v‚Äôs other less developed countries and between some of the different communities around our county (one of my best friends comes from a lovely African community where food is a huge part of their lives and they try to waste nothing! It blew my mind that lunch on Sunday‚Äôs they eat the whole bird including the cooked chicken bones with the actual meet). As a bit of a consumer this inspired me to try and change my ways. 

Me and my son bought a total of 3 magic bags yesterday from 3 different stores. All 3 bags came up within a couple of hours watching the App and were within 5 miles from each other with similar collection times. So far so good. 


First up was an order with a ¬£3 bag from Costa. Collection time was between 2 and 6pm. We arrived at 5:45 to find the shop door  was locked and the girl rolled her eyes, made an exasperated expression and mouthed through the window that they were closed despite the opening hours on the door listed as 6pm. Wasted journey but oh well, you win some you loose some, on to the next. 

Next on the list was a ¬£3.34 bag from Budgens. This was the biggest disappointment and I complained both in person and via the app. The order indicates food was supposed to come to a minimum of ¬£10 off the shelf value, but this didn‚Äôt even come close. We arrived and spoke with the staff behind the counter (a lady and a young lad) who then rolled her eyes and produced a tiny bag that she walked past us and around the shop holding without speaking to us but making comments to the younger staff member about not putting anything else in. She did this while acting as though we didn‚Äôt exist, and on making it back to the counter, went to pick some bread off the reduced stand while still talking to the young lad, and finally said I won‚Äôt put that in as there‚Äôs one in there already. She handed us the order again without speaking to us, then called us back just before the door to insist she witnessed the swipe to collect. At that point I looked at the order and in the bag was 4 sorry looking items. I asked her if there was anything missing as it was supposed to equal ¬£10, to which she grunted you only get what I give you. Already feeling humiliated I chose not to argue and left the shop. In the car I put the 4 items on the dash to take a picture of. 

These were: 

1. A packet of processed coated chicken strips ¬£2.60 marked down to ¬£1.30
2. A packet of crumbed ham ¬£1.19 marked down to ¬£0.59
3. A tiny loaf of white bread ¬£1.10 marked down to ¬£0.55
4. A pack of 4 corner yogurts ¬£2.99 marked down to ¬£1.50

The total marked down price was ¬£3.94, and the total full price for off the shelf was ¬£7.88 

I would never normally buy the ham or the chicken, however I would still have got a better deal to pick these things off the shelf than order the magic (or should that be tragic) bag to save the 60 pence and the humiliation of feeling like we were there to beg for scraps. In all honesty it‚Äôs put me off further orders.

Lastly, we collected a ¬£4 bag from Nisa. This was a much better experience and we were given 2 small carrier bags containing everything from 6 Scotch eggs, some Ginsters ham and cheese slices and chicken Kiev‚Äôs, to pre packed chicken sandwiches, ready meals and some strawberries. This one saved the day really as there was a huge amount of food there for the ¬£4, however my only small complaint was apart from one small punnet of fruit, the rest of the food was all super processed, unhealthy and what I would consider junk food. I did rate this order as 5* on the app out of fairness to the store as it was still good value for money but with a very low nutrition value. As a seasoned scratch cook, I was hoping for fresh raw ingredients to save from the bin that I could prepare and cook with. There wasn‚Äôt really anything to prepare a meal with in there however I didn‚Äôt knock down the rating for this as I understand it‚Äôs a surprise and you don‚Äôt get to choose. 

Overall the volume of food from Nisa wasn‚Äôt enough to convince me to brave the reactions from the staff and try again. I‚Äôve had a few Morrison‚Äôs boxes in the past with mixed reviews, the positive feedback here being the contents at least being mostly healthy and fairly good value, however the negatives being some of the quality being poor, off or inedible with long waits for collection. I was excited to see more places joining the scheme, it‚Äôs just a shame the idea seems to be better than the experience in practice.",1,Trustpilot,2021-02-09
"Budgens in Wellington Somerset Budgens in Wellington Somerset. 
I paid for 2 magic bags and picked up around 6.30pm. A young girl was sat on the floor filling magic bags with 'eat by today' food, pastries,  vegetables,  pizza  and punnets of grapes. I kindly asked the young lady if she wouldnt mind changing a few items in one of my magic bags as I ordered 2 and the produce was exactily the same in each of my bags. She couldn't.  The diced beef packs 'use by today packs' she pushed to the back of the fridge. She priced up my 'magic' bags already she said and couldn't change the bags contents or make up a fresh bag for me when I asked to swap a couple of items for the diced beef. I went home with alot of produce that needed eating that night. It is now in the food waste bin. Totally waste of time, unthoughtful and non empathtic of familys depending on 'out of date food' so to make a family meal . The young adults who are trained to make up these magic bags do so with good intentions but have no idea what a family needs when eating on a budget. Disappointed, won't be using Budgens again. I also experienced simular from Morrisons in Taunton. Young adults piling up lots of punnets of fruit 'eat buy today'  dates. Pastries that looked worse for wear and nothing to make a meal from. The food is going to be thrown and discarded so why are these highly profitable food suppliers still trying to make money and squeeze low income families out of little they have during lockdown. They are throwing partly rotten, inedible, un variable food in these 'magic' wonderful, profit bags to cut the cost in getting rid of it themselves.??",1,Trustpilot,2021-02-08
"Morrisons Magic Bags - tiny amount of wholly rotten food Too Good To Go is a great idea - if stores do not use this to offload rotten goods. I have twice now had Magic bags from Morrisons with much less food than the minimum 10 pounds worth. The first was donuts and mouldy teacakes in a tiny paper bag. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I tried again. The second was full of food unfit for human consumptions: mango oozing black stuff and stinking; potatoes that were green, sprouting and soft; every single item had to go in the bin. The worst part was, this was for a vulnerable, disabled adult who may well have eaten this if I had not checked. Morrisons were awful in response, very arrogant, unapologetic and blamed Too Good to Go citing that this is who I paid. The risk to health was clearly created by Morrisons. It is not a one off and Morrisons appear, at least for the most part, to be dumping rotten food this way.",1,Trustpilot,2021-02-07
"Went to a Eurogarage Went to a Eurogarage, Clayton Brook, chorley to pick up a magic bag.  They wouldnt give us one said it one had been picked up.  I showed them the app to say that we had ordered one but were adamant that only one had been ordered and it had been picked up.

by the time we got home that app had been changed to say we had picked it up.

Its only ¬£3.50 so no great monetary loss but to say Im disgusted doesnt even touch the sides.

Im hoping I get a response from toogoodtogo but more so, having emailed eurogarages, I hope I get a decent response from them too.

Joined this because I do care about the environment and especially food waste.

"The concept is great The concept is great, but in practice can leave many feeling disappointed.
There is no consistency even between the stores of the same company, eg : one morrisons may actually give the full quoted value where as another may give you a third. I do not think the stores are being fully trained on The concept or running of TGTG. One week you could get a fantastic suprise to be followed by a wasted trip and not the value you purchased the following time.
If TGTG could get on top of this it would really help, maybe local volunteers who work through it with stores?
I even had one order cancelled while I was outside the store, 3 minutes before collection.
The hassle of sending photos when things go wrong and the feeling like you are begging for your payment back can leave you with a bitter aftertaste.
To all considering it give it a go but do not leave the store til you have checked your suprise bag as I now leave empty handed rather than have the hassle of customer services when it's not sufficient.

"I love what you‚Äôre doing I love what you‚Äôre doing. I ordered a spa bag and got;

A loaf of hovis bread

Chicken popcorn bites

And water melon slices

I paid 3.09. Okay so you might not always get what you like but it‚Äôs good value for ¬£3. I have to say it‚Äôs a bit saddening to read all of these reviews about being disappointed with what you get because it‚Äôs a risk but a bargain.

All added up to about ¬£5 before reduced discounts are included, not the ¬£10 claimed, and under ¬£3 with the reduced stickers applied. So actually paid more money on this app than what it was worth in Morrisons. 

On top of that, the bread and rolls were all 5 days out of date, doughnuts 4 days, and apples 3 days.

"I love TGTG I love TGTG!

This said, we've not yet had one we've been disappointed in. Yes, when you count up the reduced price it sometimes doesn't add up to ¬£10, but it is always well over the ¬£3 the bags cost. 
We've tried some nice new foods we wouldn't normally have bought, and I like to think of it as a 'ready steady cook' experience in the evening, coming up with a dinner out of the bag's contents.

"Morrisons bag Ordered 2 Morrisons bags and no one seemed to know where they were when I enquired the store. Eventually located and brought to me. I only wish I'd opened the bags before I left the store! Each of the 2 bags contained at least 2 bags of lettuce, one of them actually contained 3 bags of prepped iceberg lettuce, a bowl of mixed lettuce leaves and a bag of little gem lettuce. Also 3 boxes of very ripe, (going mouldy), tomatoes, 3 boxes of strawberries already mouldy. There was one packet of crumpets and one bag of herbs. 4 bags of tangerines which tasted off so I threw them out. Definitely not worth the money. I would not have picked any of it from the reduced counter. Some of the items had already been reduced to 1penny so its clear these were items destined for the bin till someone in the office decided it was a good idea to use TGTG. 

I did report to the TGTG help desk and was refunded price of one bag.  There was certainly less in each bag than I had expected and no variety at all. Certainly not ¬£10 value, unless that is the value of each item when it was in date. Altogether a VERY disappointing experience.

When I told her each bag was supposingly to have a value of ¬£10 she told me her manager said 1x sandwich and 1 x piece of cake for each bag. I then told her this was not what was advertised and after much tooing and throwing I wanted her to cancel my order and give me a refund as I feel that the advertisement was misleading and false. Refund Denied !! She disappeared and returned stating the manager said this and the manager said that in a rude manner, unprofessional and poorly trained. I did end up with a couple of extra sandwiches in all.I am sad to say that the experience I had this time was poor and I felt that I had been mislead by the ¬£10 bag value ( as it was clearly not a ¬£10 bag value ) and I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth on this occasion.

"It's A Big Gamble... It's A Big Gamble... 
We were excited to learn about the TooGoodToGo app. The concept is really good. However as I read somewhere else I believe not all businesses are honest. 

We ordered from Bonai Bites- Manchester Curry. They were friendly. We got kebab meat, white rice and curry sauce. It felt like such a wast of time, energy and money to drive 10 minutes for it and on top of that the food didn't taste good and I was ill afterwards. 

We also ordered from KHB bakery and that one was good. It felt like good value for money also. 

We gave 2 stars because of Bonai Bites.  We would never use them again. We were considering never using he app again but may because of the KHB experience.

It does seem like the app itself is a good idea but what you get may not be worth your time energy and money depending on the business that you shop with. This may create waste as a result. 

We believe what may help is if you also have some knowledge of what may be in your bag. If we knew what would be in our bag from Bonai Bites, there is no way we would waste gas, time, energy and money to go there... In this way we are not really solving the wastage problem.",2,Trustpilot,2020-08-29
"great app, improved a lot recently I've been using this app since 2019 and absolutely love it. Before coming across TGTG, I used Karma app so I was familiar with the concept. 
I had a few problems with orders in the past, however seems like they improved a lot recently.

One place was closed when I came to pick my order. Contacted customer service and got a refund, no problem. 
One time I came to pick my order, but was told that there is nothing left. Contacted customer service and got a refund.
Another time I went to pick up a magic bag from a local supermarket and was given 2 bottles of veggie stock. Disappointing, but contacted customer service, they were very understanding and gave me a refund.
Obviously, when this kind of things happen it is disappointing and you feel like you wasted your time, but I guess it happens, its food...its hard to predict what is going to sell and what is not...

Apart from a few incidents I am very pleased with this app. I know a lot of it depends on a place, but I would say overall it is good value for money. It is amazing to see more and more new places participating.

Great idea but needs some work I have used TGTG a few times and it's usually quite good. Never had orders cancelled on me or a really bad bag. Having said that I feel that it needs better coordination. The majority of the businesses listed in my area never have anything to sell. It kind of clutters the app when I know that they haven't sold anything for months. So in my area there aren't that many businesses participating in real terms if you remove the inactive ones. I also understand that you can't always expect a massive amount of good quality food but businesses should be honest. If the food is no longer edible or they have so little left that it doesn't even cover the money you paid then they should cancel the order well ahead of time or not over-promise the amount of food you might have left at the end of the day. They should also inform their staff in advance as some have no clue about TGTG. I have fewer problems with small businesses. I also feel that some businesses don't actually sell leftovers but use TGTG as a promotional opportunity to advertise their food which kind of defeats the object.,3,Trustpilot,2020-08-21

"Morrison‚Äôs Box is Great Value for money I decided to use the app for the first time and ordered a box from my local Morrison‚Äôs for ¬£3.09.
The store worker came out with a huge box. It was well above ¬£10 worth. Included fresh grapes, loads of tins of beans / soup , fizzy drinks, fresh eggs, bread, lemons, crisps, Jaffa cakes, a big bag of Potatoes And 4 tins of tuna! 
I was very surprised as literally nothing was out of date. All in all excellent service and would certainly recommend. Although I was expecting products that had a yellow sticker on them, so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve prevented food waste. However I cannot complain and the staff were all very friendly too.

Also really great that they're getting those big chains on there that just throw away so much food away at the end of the day.

"3 collections- a mixed review I am relatively happy with my too good to go experience thus far. 
I have collect 2 magic bags from morrison‚Äôs and one from lola‚Äôs bakery (not the cupcake stand) 
at my first morrison‚Äôs collection no one knew what i was talking about and a guy finally came out and made me up a box, of about 30 apples and some berries, limes and avocados. it was definitely above the ¬£10 value but lacking in variety. i was able to make use of the items and share with others 

the second collection was at a different morrison‚Äôs branch and on sunday. the shop was really busy and i had to queue at the kiosk, then an announcement was made, when the colleague finally got to me i was asked to wait for 5 mins while she cleared the basket queue. then she came back to get my trolly (have a trolly to hand folks!) 
i had to wait for about 20-30 mins for this collection but the variety of items was significantly better. This time i got a huge bag of potatoes. some mixed salad leaves, a couple cucumbers, a very past it avocado, lots of bread, some cheese and onion slices. strawberries, tomatoes, apples, sweet peppers, 2 packets of mushrooms and a solitary orange. this was a really successful collection.

Lolas bakery-i was hoping for some cupcakes or a slice of cake. because it‚Äôs the bakery and not the cupcake stand the magic bag contents were mixed. i got a v past it salad (went in the bin) 2 cupcakes that weren‚Äôt something i would choose but my daughter was delighted, i think one was gluten free it was v crumbly. a chia and raspberry yogurt pot. a veggie burger with very hard bread-not really edible for me and 2 almond croissants which were delicious, not everything was quite to my taste especially as there was so much variety in the store at the time. the collection was easy the staff member knew what i was collecting and it was already in a bag and ready to go. 

i will definitely continue to use too good to go. especially for grocery items. 

(i think i get a little thrill out of the mystery of the contents!) 

it‚Äôs definitely pushing me to be more creative in the kitchen and i do like being able to share my items with family and friends.

"Can be brilliant, but very inconsistent I've used TGTG many times in many different places all over London, and the word that sums it up is 'inconsistent'.

First off, the app itself works really well. In terms of the user experience, I've had everything from unexpected windfalls of much more than I was expecting (extremely rare), to showing up to find virtually nothing left (pretty rare), and everything in between. To be fair, on the occasions that there has been a genuine problem (like a place being closed, or no food left) the app staff have been quick to refund. 

When you find somewhere that treats the principle of TGTG well and professionally, you have found a gem that you can keep going back to. I love the idea of TGTG but the execution of it by the various outlets is so varied that I have used it less and less because trying anywhere new is taking a shot in the dark. 

Sometimes the staff have no idea what you're talking about, the portion size/value is a lot less than indicated, I've been asked to wait 45 minutes because 'TGTG is not the priority', received items that bear no resemblance to the listing, etc etc. Definitely completely ignore the crossed out price in the app that is supposed to indicate the value of the goods you will get, I have rarely seen any outlet bear this even vaguely in mind.

It's got to be tough for the TGTG people, because the idea is great, but exercising quality control over how it is offered by so many different types of places must be near impossible.

Bottom line: if you find a place that does it well (like Planet Organic), stick with it and you will be delighted. Anywhere new and you are taking a potshot at how it will go, and the likelihood of getting the value of goods described in the app is low so don't go out of your way. 

All that said, I have enjoyed many delicious food items, but after using it for about a year it has lost of a lot of its lustre.",3,Trustpilot,2020-07-19

I even tried a sushi restaurant and got a huge tray of fresh sushi from that day for like 7 euros. Absurd that people are complaining about food being at almost the sell by date or being too much dairy or too much bread or whatever. The entire point is that you get what is left at the end of the day or about to expire. It's so inexpensive for that reason! Tip for bread or juices if it's too much: freeze it! The one missing star is for my one bad experience with a restaurant exploiting the service just to sell side salads at a marked up price. I paid 6 euros for a ""magic box"" from a poke bowl restaurant. When I got there they handed me one small side salad. No rice, no fish poke, none of the special toppings. It was a tiny salad of lettuce, tomato, shredded carrot. Supposedly worth 14 euros, now 6 euros, according to the app. Honestly, 6 was much too expensive. I couldn't believe it. I should have been suspicious that they always have many ""magic boxes"" available, all throughout the day.  I wrote TGTG but they responded that they determined it was sufficient (I expect they always determine that). So that was a disappointment, as I had anticipated a poke bowl with at least some of the ingredients as described in the app, and biked a ways to pick it up. Still, Too Good To Go has been a really great experience the other 10 or so times I have used it. When I get too much for me to eat on my own, I share the food with my elderly neighbor, who is always delighted.",4,Trustpilot,2020-04-14

Got my first magic bag from my local nisa store. It states 'expect an assortment of pizzas, ready Neal's, fruit and veg, ham, cheese, juices, bread, cakes and pastries'
I recieved two loaves of bread(can anybody eat two loaves in one night?) , 2 ready made rolls(so more bread), a pot of couscous which I dont even like. And a pot of cherries.

Purchased a bag from Warsaw Superstore ashton under lyne, yesterday.

They advertise a selection of goods,fresh fruit, veg, bread,snacks, groceries and more.

I accept that the bag won't contain all,or any, of these things but would expect a bit of a selection and some variation.

What did I get in total ?

1) 1 x small bag of oats.
2) 3 x small packs of cookies.
3) 1 x child's yoghurt.
4) 2 x child's chocolate yoghurts.
5) 3 x chocolate cheese.
6) 2 x cream cheese.

I couldn't read the date on item (1)

Items 2 - 6 all were out of date on the 5th.

Not good is it.

I live on my own so there is no way I would attempt to eat this quantity of out of date dairy food.

It's quite a large store so I'm certain that it wouldn't have been any problem for them to put a couple of items of fruit and veg, or bread products rather than dump this pile of end of life rubbish on me.

I won't be using again.",1,Trustpilot,2020-03-06

"Great concept but certainly not‚Ä¶ Great concept but certainly not utilised in the best way to prevent food going to waste. Bought twice with the app- first time small cafe, food was good quality but you get the feeling that staff are a bit stingy. For ¬£2.99 got a panini, a small lemon tartlet and a granola square; it was tasty but there was loads of leftover food on the counter and no more bags available through the app so the question is what is happening to all those salads and sandwiches that are still sitting there near to the closing time? 

Second experience was terrible- buffet place advertising a fantastic selection of Asian and Indian dishes at ¬£4 per box. It's a shame they don't tell you the box can barely house a regular size sandwich! The size of the box was a joke- filling it to the brim with the lid coming off you couldn't get enough food enough for an adult's meal. The collection time was 14:30-15:00. Arrived just after 14:30 and the staff were already clearing up; all that was left was some noodles, rice and onion bhajis. I mean come on! Surely buffets are risky places to run in terms of food waste- as an all you can eat place they must buy more food than they can sell so where does it all go at the end of the day? For ¬£4 this was an absolute joke, and you feel like a beggar trying to stuff the tiny container! For the record- we didn't go there to save cash- really just wanted to save food from going in the bin. 

You really get the feeling the food establishments don't give a toss about food waste, rather they try to recoup their losses for the food they have to throw away. It just can't work like that; as a good establishment why bother joining the scheme if you know you won't let people benefit? I dread to think how much food went in the bin today at that buffet place- and all because the company is trying to be clever with the customers.

"3 kilos of out of date bread. I think this is a fantastic idea but definitely open to abuse by supermarkets. We managed to secure a magic box from Gainsborough Morrisons which they called a ¬£10 box when we picked it up.
It was advertised as containing products from Market Street (Deli, bakery, fruit and veg etc) but mostly contained out of date loaves from the bread aisle (not Market Street) 3 x 800g loaves, a 400g gluten free loaf (yuck) and a packet of gluten free sandwich thins (double yuck). To be fair we also got a cucumber, some cherry tomatoes and some cupcakes from Market Street but I think it's a bloody cheek to try and unload the crappy out of date bread into these magic boxes as it's next to useless.
Such a pity as I want this to work so much but it's not quite right yet.",2,Trustpilot,2019-12-08
"The value of this app is entirely‚Ä¶ The value of this app is entirely dependent on the restaurant you try to use, with many more interested in making last minute sales than in actually salvaging wasted food. 

Carveries tend to be a good place to start as they will always have plenty of left over food. Yo Sushi is particularly strong, actively holding back massive trays of food for app users.

Morrisons tend to be hot or miss depending on the store you go to. Sometimes you can get a big box of fruit and veg (as pictured in the news) whereas other stores will throw a load of bread and cakes into a box with the 5p stickers still attached (ergo the box was worth ¬£10 at a full price, but got reduced to under a pound in store before being sold to you for ¬£3.30 after it goes OOD). One Morrisons store included products that were over a month out of date and mouldy. However 2G2G will refund orders if you have legitimate concerns.

Some restaurants will just sell you a portion of food that was originally sold for the ¬£3.50 asking price even though the app says it should be ¬£7 worth of food, but you'll learn to avoid these places.

Overall I have been extremely happy with 2G2G for its breakfast, Carvery, and Sushi options, and I did get a weeks worth of vegetables once. However I have had some less than great experiences and was personally disturbed by one order so always accept the possibility of disappointment and enjoy the wins as they roll in.",3,Trustpilot,2019-12-07

Thought at first the concept was great and very good value for money, but now feel they have let their standards slip as the amount of food which fits in the container looks very mean, and probably only half of what would be on a normal carvery.

"Great app, but it comes down to the actual shop! There seems to be a fair amount of negative feedback at the moment, so I wanted to chime in with something positive.  I used this app for the first time yesterday to grab a magic bag from The Bakehouse in Putney.  I've bought from them before, so knew it's high quality and I thought it would be a chance to try something new from them. I didn't expect much, but was blown away by my bag and experience.  I got two sausage rolls, two cheese sticks, a muffin, a pastry and an entire loaf of their famous sourdough (the cost alone is more than I paid for the bag).  The staff welcomed me with enthusiasm and happily handed over my pre-packed bag.  It's a grab bag, so I wouldn't expect to always receive so much if they had a busy day.  And I'd continue to pop in when I needed a loaf specifically, but I will certainly be using the app again to order another magic bag when I feel like mixing it up.  

All that said, I'm not sure I would trust a national chain.  Staff are less likely to be informed, or invested.  Whereas with a locally owned or small business that buys into the philosophy of the app, I imagine you'd have a much better experience consistently.

The app itself was dead easy to use.  The one element on my wishlist would be proper reviews rather than just a rating.  I'd like to hear what other people got or experienced to judge whether I should take the risk.",5,Trustpilot,2019-11-19

It may well have cost that much if you had gone in and ordered these boxes but definitely nothing close to the claimed ¬£15 value. And, of course, it was Hobson's choice so no chance of asking for any of the delicious looking food going begging in the display. Still, my son tells me that he has had some great meals so I may give it a second chance sometime but, for now, very much underwhelmed.",2,Trustpilot,2019-08-26

Another day, another venue and I want to say this right off the bat.. If I purchase ¬£6 worth of food on the app, I expect to get AT LEAST ¬£6 worth from the restaurant, call me unrealistic but I expect my monies worth, I'm not in the habit of giving money away FULL STOP.
My Indian Street food (Stretford Manchester) I ordered one meat option and one veg option for a cost of ¬£3.09 each.. On arrival owners were very friendly, I have no qualms there at all.. they were expecting the good to go buyer when I arrived and produced 2 small chicken tikka wraps.... (crickets)............ So I mentioned the veg option? To which the lady knew nothing about. Soooo because a little red sparrow would have trouble filling up on the wrapps, I purchased 2 portions of rice & chicken and two onion bajee at an additional cost of ¬£6 so I'm now ¬£12 in. 
Got home and had two small square tin foil containers, half filled with food so the rice rattled around, 2 mini onion baghee and the 2 chicken wraps (tortilla bread BTW not naan) all for the princely sum of ¬£12!

At least! And I understand the ethos and the magic bag concept ie you get what is available but one small tortilla wrap for ¬£3? Considering they had baghees, they had rice and chicken, the shop was due to close and was empty? ... I would have thought they would have given a bit more as part of the magic bag?

All vegetarian (I'm not, but am fine with tasty veggie foods), and the quantity was amazing. For ¬£2, I got 4 roasted butternut squash, spiced couscous and pesto crusty rolls, 2 ciabatta rolls stuffed with spiced falafel/beanburger, hummus, slaw and salad. Add in 2 slices of carrot cake and a giant chocolate fudge cookie, and it'll keep me going for a good day or two. 

Quality was excellent, the food fresh, and was waiting for me (still warm on cases) when I arrived. I surmise the idea is best suited to singles or couples, as it's never quite certain you'll get a full meal. For me, I can assemble a healthy meal out of various bits, so it's ideal.

By my calculations I've got nigh on ¬£20 of lovely bits for a tenth of the price - and I've done my bit for food wastage in the bargain.

"Great initiative but need better execution I'd say it's great initiative and the app is great, but the 1 star deduction is due to the dependability on the restaurants themselves and the fact that users can do nothing about it.
I've seen critical reviews saying they got food that should have just gone to the bin so I was quite unsure about trying to order on TGTG, but just tried it for the first time with my favourite restaurant in town yesterday. I got 4 big scones and 1 macaron in the bag. Here's the thing, the scones are perfectly fine and tasty as usual (I'm a die hard fan for their scones so I know their usual taste and price), and the price of the bag makes it a really really good bargain. However, that 1 macaron was crushed and hard and crunchy, nothing like you'd expect from a restaurant that excels at bakeries.
I think the bag quality can be a lot more controlled if they allow users to leave reviews on the restaurants, say based on verified purchase or photo proof? And maybe by then I'll find this a 5 star app.",4,Trustpilot,2019-05-04

Also there was no checks done on my phone as to if I had paid, as I showed the cashier he asked if I had paid, I should of not paid, said I had and left the store with free food.

My main down-side with this one is they could be a bit more up-front about the fact that food places may well sell out, and cancel on you an hour before (you're asked to give *them* 3 hours), meaning that your food plan for the day is thrown off.

- meal sized tuna salad expiry 8/4. As it was 19:15 when I could pick it up this went straight in the bin - don't mess with tuna that is not freshly opened
- duo pack of cauliflower and broccoli. The cauliflower had brown bits on it and the broccoli had gone yellow
- vegetable puree mix that had already started putrifying at the bottom of the pot (8/4)
- bag of Italian stir fry veg (8/4). Looks a bit squashy but may still be ok tomorrow
- one person ready meal (9/4). Ok but pretty useless as there are three of us
- loaf of bread that is fresh and looks fine
- litre pack of vla (9/4) but the packet has 'bloated' implying that it hasn't been stored at the correct temperature
- one small protein yoghurt drink (9/4)
- two greek yoghurts (9/4)

Essentially, I had just *paid* money to go and (unknowingly) collect rubbish. Not cool. This sort of thing really needs to be sorted out.

"App owners must state their purpose. Downloaded the app as a fiirst time user and made the payment in 2 hours or less to buy something  - So hence my review/advice is - if you are providing this service for a sit down ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô their app should clearly say the following in my opinion

- only for takeaway service(for e.g buffet restaurants)
- container size is as specified by the restaurant (economic value is important for a price concious customer UNLESS the app says it is a charity)

I still wish them good luck since I think they are supporting a good cause in my view (hence 3 stars)",3,Trustpilot,2019-01-04
"Rubbish Rubbish. I tried this three times. 

First time I paid ¬£4 for a pile of rice and large bowl of palak paneer but the staff made weird comments when I went to collect it, like ""we normally give it away to the homeless"" so it wasn't a very nice experience. No choice and on the app it describes the ""magic bag"" as containing several items such as fluffy naan bread and crunchy poppadoms. The variety described was not on offer and although the quantity was good and enough for two people, my wife didn't like the food so I finished it off for breakfast the next day.

The second time I paid ¬£3 for a sandwich and a cookie, and I was given no choice as to what the sandwich was, but it was ok, prosciutto, pesto and rocket, just the rocket in it was limp and greasy so it couldn't have been sold at full price anyway. 

The point is to stop good food being thrown away not to sell stuff that should be in the bin already. On top of that it doesn't seem like good value for money when you have to pay up front and might end up being given something you really don't like. Prices seem to be about half to two thirds of restaurant prices in any case.

The third time I went to collect vegan asian food from Gloucester Road and they just said they had sold out. Even though I had already paid. I showed my receipt but got no food. Went home sad, hungry, freezing cold and feeling like waste had been created rather than saved. Waste of my time and effort.

I am happy to collect leftovers at the end of the evening to get some cheap food, prevent waste and give a bit of extra money to the restaurant, but what you're getting here is not good value. 

Restaurants seem to resent giving anything away cheap and are only happy if they can sell their rubbish at inflated prices.",1,Trustpilot,2019-01-04
"Seems to list food and take your money regardless of whether the business is even open, let alone has food Paid for on of too bags of food that a cafe had available. Got to the premises and it was not only shut, but had clearly been shut for at least the whole day. It's on a university premises and all the shops and cafes were shut so this was obviously planned. Yet, the app listed food available and took my money. Have contacted customer services to ask how this can happen, and how to get a refund. Looking at other reviews I don't hold out much hope of getting either a response or my money back.",1,Trustpilot,2018-12-28

"First TGTG order (YO! Sushi, Southampton) I can only speak from my one experience, but I bought two portions today for YO! Sushi, in Southampton. I walked up at the earliest collection time and was immediately approached by a member of staff who could clearly tell what I wanted. She swiftly checked my receipt and handed over two containers. 

Some reviewers had warned of caf√© and restaurant servers not being familiar with the app, but for me the seamlessness of the process was impressive.

The portion sizes were more than adequate, and I will be using TGTG again - I can only hope that other partners work as well with the concept!",5,Trustpilot,2018-11-18

Was reminded by email DON'T BE LATE or else can't collect. Arrived over 10 minutes before the deadline but the shop was shut up tight with a note saying it had closed early due to a burst water pipe. So no way of collecting so called leftovers. Emailed toogoodtoogo customer service and have yet only received an automated response. 

Don't use the app, it's not updated if there is a problem or closure at the shop, they will take your money anyway and it seems there is no hope of a refund. Disappointing for the first time using the app. Definitely won't be using again.",1,Trustpilot,2018-11-17

Then the ‚Äúsurprise portion‚Äù was a sealed plastic container of rice and thin soup, clearly not left over food or the ‚Äúwok or salad‚Äù in the description but more likely produced to sell to TGTG app users. And there was a stack of these ready to go. A big disappointment.

"Firstly I thought it was a very good‚Ä¶ Firstly I thought it was a very good idea, and I was happy with what I received.  But recently I found out that some places just try to make extra money, not really saving food. 

At the beginning I ordered from OSTEHUSET & ROMS√òES. I was so sattisfied, but recently I feel like the portions from OSTEHUSET are getting smaller. Not sure if it's coincidence or not...? 

I bought breakfast from SCANDIC HOTEL, it was terrible! The portion was so small and I felt like I got leftover from someone's plate. She even put dead/rotten rucollas & tomatoes in my box. Pancake was already cut in the middle and she put it over runny egg! 
I like to save food but I don't want to eat from someone's plate?!  Who knows if the person was sick or had disease etc... 

It took quite long waiting for her to prepare the box, she was quite rude and preparing for someone else there... I think I was the last person at that time. Finally she brought me two boxes, but when she realised I ordered only one portion, she took back the other box. Obviously not saving the rest of the food?!?! 

Then I thought food from cafes would be better. So I ordered from STEAM KAFFEBAR... Just before the pick up time, suddenly they opened again for few more portions. What I received even worse: one kanelboller, a very small piece of sandwich, and a small bread with cheese inside. That's all! Since they opened for more portions just before pick up time, it was obvious that they were just trying to make business out of this idea! It wasn't worth it at all to go all the way there to receive 3 pcs of random food. I could get better food from a place closer to my place at my own time! 

Now I'm 'scared' to buy again from other places because I don't know what I will get... It also takes effort to go to a certain place at a certain time frame. Now I only buy from one place that I know for sure it's good. 

I think we the customers should be able to give reviews for every place we have ordered or even put pictures of what we received. This way we know what we are getting and no place can 'cheat' different customers over and over again. The idea is to save food, not to make extra business!",2,Trustpilot,2018-10-25
"Great app Great app - was just a little unsure what I was actually ordering or going to be given until I arrived - but turned out to be super tasty and great value.

"I would have given it 5 stars I would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for the awfully uninspiring selection, from one of the cafes/restaurants.

I've ordered three times via this app, and two out of three times the good I received was excellent.

Top marks for Small Batch Coffee Company, a lovely selection of croissants, pastries and even a Croque Madame, for a very decent price of just ¬£2.50
Next come Sugardough, a nice selection of croissants and pastries for ¬£3.00.

The let down being Patisserie Valerie.
NO wonder they're facing a financial crisis!

For ¬£3.59 only three cakes/pastries and then some choc orange cookie crumb, some apple tart and some apple almond frangipan.
I mean why not make it only 2 items for the same price and MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE APPLE AND APPLE ONLY?

So as you've guessed I hate apple desserts of any kind! 

Oh and before somebody says 'hmm maybe that's all they had', no, they had quite an amount of other pastries/cakes slices etc, but they chose to give me awful types of pastries

Oh and of course before anybody else says-the reason I didn't observe what I was given, was because the other two companies gave me delicious, amazing and a very decent variety of excellent foods-without me looking at what they were giving me.

Yeah I get it 'look next time', but that's beside the point.

So anyway beware of apple only products (I'm surprised that the third option wasn't just apple sauce or mousse) being given to you at Patisserie Valerie.

I shall tell everybody I know to avoid PV-as they have nothing of value to offer (unless of course you were apple-fed born & bred) and ¬£3.59 is not good enough, considering you want to help on food waste.",4,Trustpilot,2018-10-14

The second time was on Wednesday and yet again I received the same warm welcome from Javier, a young lady called Martha and also I think one of the chefs which you don‚Äôt get in many places. I‚Äôm looking forward to actually eating in there not just for the good food, but also the excellent customer service too.

"So Aberdeen exceeds its name it is Soooo Good To Good To Go is amazing App, easy to use for confirmed technophobic like myself.
Concept of excellent food at a reduced price is amazing, not only environmentally friendly, helps food poverty, introduces user to new places to eat and word of mouth valuable business tool to keep in restaurants in business, support local economy plus providing jobs. 
It is a win all round.
I am split on if I should say how fabulous So in Aberdeen is or do I keep secret all to myself....I am generous so will share.
Food outstanding, Customer Service Amazing, I can't recommend highly enough. 
Staff remember you from previous visits and it has become my favorite place to recommend
It is all to easy to give negative feedback but a real pleasure to thank staff at So Aberdeen.
If there are ever to be To Good To Go awards So Aberdeen will be hard to beat.
So...no pun intended come on Aberdeen businesses, get on board sign up to innovative App and expand your Business Opportunities.
I only found App by chance and I know publicity expensive but National a To Good To Go day to highlight your innovation might bring it to wider customer base.
I am delighted as are friends and family will always go to So but would love to try more places in Aberdeen.

"Don't waste your time Ordered for the first time yesterday, thinking I would a nice meal, after reading decent feedback on trustpilot... However, After a 35 minute walk to the restaurant at 21:30 at night, the employees were all packing away the restaurant, and they all screamed ""closed closed please leave"". Immediately feeling obnoxious, the manager approached me and said come tomorrow we are closed. ""Too Good To Go"" had all their timings wrong, leaving me in the dark, with nothing. Not going to use this service again, if the company had direct thought behind their idea, the app, they would get their schedule correct - but they don't. Horrendous mistake, leaving a very unhappy customer and a very negative word of mouth about ""toogood to go"". I wouldn't waste your time, it's cheap for a reason.

"Updated: Everyone please be careful for fraud from the app! Updated: So as can seen from the company's reply below. It was so sincere. There is no apology.

And yes, they do not even bother to address my name, but only a simple hi. All service attitude in one reply, well done. 

Everyone please be careful! You might never got your refunds back from the canceled meals. And I am using the app in Denmark! 

I had nice experiences with the food stores. But the company running the App is disappointing and doesn‚Äôt care a thing about the customers. Two of my purchases in June got cancelled because there weren‚Äôt any leftover food. My bank confirmed me the app has charged me to both of the purchases, but never transferred me the refunds. I tried to contact the app company many times. First they denied they owed me the refunds, then they accused my bank to be the one holding my money.

"Restaurant not playing fair Just used the app for the first time so not really sure what to make of it yet.

The concept is great not only for the environment, restaurant cost saving on waste and customer saving a little cash but only if the restaurant adheres to the concept.

The restaurant which I selected talked about the staff will fill a magic bag with whatever is left and had an extensive list of food on offer subject to change day to day.

When I reached the restaurant I was quickly greeted and order acknowledged however I was told they only offer one dish, shawarma, either lamb, chicken or mixed. Puzzled me as I thought the idea was whatever surplus food was left over they would fill a magic bag so asked is it just shawarma and nothing else like salads, starters and other dishes. They only give shawarma so choose lamb.

Clearly they had other dishes especially the salads, starters and more meat items available and on offer but they either will sell the next day or even throwaway. Even if it was just a couple or few of the items listed on the app I would‚Äôve been satisfied but only offering one portion of shawarma and not even a full portion (well that‚Äôs what it looked like when I got it home) was very disappointing.

I like the idea so won‚Äôt give up and will try again but if the restaurants aren‚Äôt adhering to the concept, it‚Äôs only another way for the restaurant to make money and nothing else, no care for the environment and reducing food waste.

Please note, nothing wrong with the app, concept or the company, it‚Äôs all great. It‚Äôs just this one restaurant experience.",5,Trustpilot,2017-09-29

No sign of the sugar cane boxes used by the App and no choice about what food we would like despite there being lots and lots of food left on the conveyor belt and in the fridge. The manager was absolutely lovely however he said it was the first time using this app, so I dont know if this is representative of the service overall as this isn't down to the app. Not sure what to make of this :/ YoSushi are doing a great thing by teaming up with the app but they either need to give more choice or a greater quantity of food for it to be good value for money as well as in reducing food wastage.",3,Trustpilot,2017-09-25

I have had many good experiences, but I will never buy something from this place again.

Quite a fat lie: they were cling filming all their left overs in front of me to keep for the next day. In the end they gave me two stale sandwiches, which is an absolute rip off for the 5 pounds that I paid. 

These sandwiches would be 3.75 on full price, so I didnt even get the at least 50% discount promised by the app. I contacted TGTG straight away to resolve the issue but no reply... With no one to complain to or no money back guarantee, you are just left in a situation where you pay in advance for food you might or might not get. Who wants this?",1,Trustpilot,2017-03-18

"TGTG is great, but not all places participating are worthwhile‚Ä¶ Scandic Oslo City It feels wrong to complain, but when they advertise with ""come rescue a large box of food"" they kind of build up your expectations. I therefore expected more than 2 slices of bread, 1 mini croissant, 2 slices of cheese, 4 slices of meat, 2 shriveled potatoes and chipolatas, with a bit of fruit and greenery - that have been laying on a buffet for hours - and a small coffee (which I don't drink). They also made me feel as if I was in a food queue for the poor. I spent NOK 35 on the food and NOK 33 on the tram and would have been better off spending that money at the local supermarket. In the ad it said to bring your own bag so I brought my fabric bag and was therefore not impressed by the 3 containers (4 if you count the coffee lid) provided to carry these ""offerings"". The aim is to reduce waste after all! I'm just glad it wasn't my first experience with TooGoodToGo or I don't think I would have used the service again. Oh well, you live and learn by trial and error, so I know which place not to buy from again. TooGoodToGo have been informed, so lets see what they do about it.

awesome Great Idea and it comes so handy being on the go most of the time. The app is a no brainer. Looking forward to seeing more and more options of restaurants and shops to be added.,5,Trustpilot,2016-12-27
"Great Idea, works seemlessly! Great idea for a company, I hate the idea of wasting food.
But love the idea of whipping it up for a bargain.
The app works great, it's easy, simple and I can pay via paypal!
All this app/ company needs now is more choice, I'm sure they're working to expand.",4,Trustpilot,2016-12-19
"Very generous selection of foods This is an exceptionally good offer. There is always a good selection of pastries. I sometimes find the bread disappointing - often plain white bread or simple brown loaves. The shop sells such a good selection of whole wheat, rugbr√∏d, danish, havre, seed-bread, etc., it would be good to get more of these. (But perhaps these are always sold out because they are more interesting!)",5,Trustpilot,2016-12-15
"Great and cheap initiative What can I say, cheap way of putting to good use the leftovers of nice food from bakeries and others.",5,Trustpilot,2016-12-06

"First try of TGTG at Moshimo Brighton I'd been meaning to give this app a try out, and tonight was the night. The ordering process was straightforward although the app didn't allow me to use PayPal (presented a blank page), and kept failing to register my debit card, but finally i was able to use my credit card successfully!  Arrived a couple of minutes before pick up time, so waited around until the allotted time arrived, then i was handed a carry out bag of glorious sushi. Took home, sat down, and ate. YUM and a bargain. Will do again.",5,Trustpilot,2016-09-05

# app_review_NLP
It's another version with less code than the first one. 
This is about building an app that could predict the rating of a review (1 to 5 stars).
First we'll use machine learning model to see if the accuracy of the prediction is good.
If not we'll try to improve it with RNN. Then building the app on streamlit.
